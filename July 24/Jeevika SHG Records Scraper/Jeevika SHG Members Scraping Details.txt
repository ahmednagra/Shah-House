Same website as last time but with different requirements. 

First goto this webpage:
http://20.198.83.63:9090/dashboard/

Then goto the link that says "Total SHG Formed"
Then click on "Member Under SHG" for each of the 5 districts.

Then click on each "SHG NAME" and download all the columns.

For these 5 districts approximate number should be about (but is probably more since these numbers are not updated):


The 5 districts I need data for are : Bhojpur , Gaya, Begusarai, Purnia, Jamui,


246140 + 582421 + 329361 + 433742 + 232635 = 1,824,299 members


All the usual caveats from last time applies. Specifically, the site is often not up, so please take your time, I just need all the data,
