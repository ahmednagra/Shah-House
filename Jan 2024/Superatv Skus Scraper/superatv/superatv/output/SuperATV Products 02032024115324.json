Before they know what hit them, they\u2019re eating your dust on your way to the top because you're equipped with SuperATV\u2019s Honda Pioneer 1000 Atlas Pro 1.5\" Forward Offset A-Arms. These rugged A-arms provide extra ground clearance, stability, and room for new 31\u201d tires on your Pioneer to help you over boulders that hold stock machines back. With these bad boys, you\u2019ll never back down from a hill again.\r\n\n\nBigger and Stronger Than Stock\n\r\nAtlas Pro A-arms are an upgrade in every way. They\u2019re 0.5\u201d larger than stock and 0.25\u201d larger than our standard high-clearance A-arms. They\u2019re super durable thanks to a UV-resistant powder coating, meaning they\u2019re immune to rust. The larger construction is eye-catching, adding an intimidation factor to your Pioneer. These A-arms ooze confidence and power. You\u2019ll take on the wildest trails with the Atlas Pros easily and make it look good too.\r\n\n\nNo Hang-Ups with Higher Clearance \n\r\nThese Atlas Pro A-Arms give you an additional 1.5\u201d of ground clearance to keep you from getting stuck. Your wheelbase is also extended, giving you more stability. Additionally, the offset allows you to run 31\u201d tires on your Pioneer without a lift. Obstacles you may have avoided in the past out of fear of hang-ups or losing balance will become bumps in the road with these control arms.\r\n\n\nCorrect Camber Saves Your Tires\n\r\nAtlas Pro A-Arms come with fully adjustable pivot blocks. They\u2019re set to factory standards for the fastest installation possible. If you\u2019ve made upgrades to your machine, you can save your tires from unnecessary wear and tear by adjusting your camber. No matter what adjustments you\u2019ve made to your side-by-side, these arms are a perfect addition.\r\n\n\nLet SuperATV Do the Work\u2014Preassembly Available!\n\r\nWant to spend more time on the trails and less time in the garage?

They thread onto your A-arms like a nut and bolt, which makes these ball joints virtually impossible to pull out. The high-quality chromoly steel stud combined with an advanced tool-steel body makes them perfect for bigger machines, bigger tires, and bigger rides. And since they\u2019re greaseable and rebuildable, you can keep them running perfectly.\r\n\n\nHeavy-Duty Ball Joints\n\r\nOur heavy-duty ball joints are designed with ultimate performance and convenience in mind. Whether you\u2019re doing flips or chasing hills, our proprietary blend of hardened 4340 VAR steel and zinc plating means this ball joint can take it. Our heavy-duty ball joints also come with easily-accessible grease zerks and an adjustable design.
