Before they know what hit them, they\u2019re eating your dust on your way to the top because you're equipped with SuperATV\u2019s Honda Pioneer 1000 Atlas Pro 1.5\" Forward Offset A-Arms. These rugged A-arms provide extra ground clearance, stability, and room for new 31\u201d tires on your Pioneer to help you over boulders that hold stock machines back. With these bad boys, you\u2019ll never back down from a hill again.\r\n\n\nBigger and Stronger Than Stock\n\r\nAtlas Pro A-arms are an upgrade in every way. They\u2019re 0.5\u201d larger than stock and 0.25\u201d larger than our standard high-clearance A-arms. They\u2019re super durable thanks to a UV-resistant powder coating, meaning they\u2019re immune to rust. The larger construction is eye-catching, adding an intimidation factor to your Pioneer. These A-arms ooze confidence and power. You\u2019ll take on the wildest trails with the Atlas Pros easily and make it look good too.\r\n\n\nNo Hang-Ups with Higher Clearance \n\r\nThese Atlas Pro A-Arms give you an additional 1.5\u201d of ground clearance to keep you from getting stuck. Your wheelbase is also extended, giving you more stability. Additionally, the offset allows you to run 31\u201d tires on your Pioneer without a lift. Obstacles you may have avoided in the past out of fear of hang-ups or losing balance will become bumps in the road with these control arms.\r\n\n\nCorrect Camber Saves Your Tires\n\r\nAtlas Pro A-Arms come with fully adjustable pivot blocks. They\u2019re set to factory standards for the fastest installation possible. If you\u2019ve made upgrades to your machine, you can save your tires from unnecessary wear and tear by adjusting your camber. No matter what adjustments you\u2019ve made to your side-by-side, these arms are a perfect addition.\r\n\n\nLet SuperATV Do the Work\u2014Preassembly Available!\n\r\nWant to spend more time on the trails and less time in the garage?

They thread onto your A-arms like a nut and bolt, which makes these ball joints virtually impossible to pull out. The high-quality chromoly steel stud combined with an advanced tool-steel body makes them perfect for bigger machines, bigger tires, and bigger rides. And since they\u2019re greaseable and rebuildable, you can keep them running perfectly.\r\n\n\nHeavy-Duty Ball Joints\n\r\nOur heavy-duty ball joints are designed with ultimate performance and convenience in mind. Whether you\u2019re doing flips or chasing hills, our proprietary blend of hardened 4340 VAR steel and zinc plating means this ball joint can take it. Our heavy-duty ball joints also come with easily-accessible grease zerks and an adjustable design.

No matter what adjustments you\u2019ve made to your side-by-side, these arms are a perfect addition.\r\n\n\nLet SuperATV Do the Work\u2014Preassembly Available!\n\r\nWant to spend more time on the trails and less time in the garage? Purchase a set of SuperATV ball joints with your A-arms and we\u2019ll install them for you for free! We save you money and time so you can get back to doing what you love.\r\n\n\nNOTE: You must re-use your stock ball joints if you don\u2019t select a pre-installed ball joint at checkout.\r\n\n\nKeller Ball Joints\n\r\nKeller Ball Joints use a two-piece design that eliminates the need for a snap ring. They thread onto your A-arms like a nut and bolt, which makes these ball joints virtually impossible to pull out. The high-quality chromoly steel stud combined with an advanced tool-steel body makes them perfect for bigger machines, bigger tires, and bigger rides. And since they\u2019re greaseable and rebuildable, you can keep them running perfectly.\r\n\n\nHeavy-Duty Ball Joints\n\r\nOur heavy-duty ball joints are designed with ultimate performance and convenience in mind. Whether you\u2019re doing flips or chasing hills, our proprietary blend of hardened 4340 VAR steel and zinc plating means this ball joint can take it. Our heavy-duty ball joints also come with easily-accessible grease zerks and an adjustable design. Extensive lab and field testing shows that our heavy-duty ball joints can withstand double the pressure of an OEM ball joint!\r", "Features": "Adds a 1.5\u201d forward offset \nFit up to 31\u201d tires\nMade with 1.5\u201d diameter tubing\n\n0.5\u201d larger than stock\n0.25\u201d larger than our standard High-Clearance 1.5\u201d Forward Offset A-Arms\n\nAdjustable lower pivot blocks for full camber adjustability \nIncludes high-quality bushings at no extra cost\nUV-resistant powder coat finish\nEasy to install\nBacked by a lifetime warranty", "Fitment": "Honda Pioneer 1000 : 2016+\nHonda Pioneer 1000-5 : 2016+\nHonda Pioneer 1000 Deluxe : 2016+\nHonda Pioneer 1000-5 Deluxe : 2016+\nHonda Pioneer 1000 Limited Edition : 2017+\nHonda Pioneer 1000-5 Limited Edition : 2017+\nHonda Pioneer 1000-6 : 2023+\n\nNOTE:\n\nPioneer 1000 or Pioneer 1000-5 Limited Edition Models will require Rhino 2.0 axles\nYou may need  wheel spacers when running 12\u201d wheels \nIf you want to run offset A-arms with our 3\" Lift Kit, you must have Rhino Brand Axles.
