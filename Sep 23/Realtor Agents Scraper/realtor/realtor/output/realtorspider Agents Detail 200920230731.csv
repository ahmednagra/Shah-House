Dallas Cain,eXp Realty in Arizona,"Greetings
I would like to inform you that after many years of corporate jobs, I have decided to take the leap and get back into the Real Estate. I had a license in the state of California for a short time, but as a single father with a mortgage of my own, I eventually needed to go back to my corporate roots to provide a steady income for my family. 

During this time I also received my Masters in Business Administration from Pepperdine University, followed shortly by a Masters in Education from the University of Phoenix. 

Now that my children are off on their own and have begun successful careers, I have decided to jump back into the Real Estate industry and start my own business which will enable me to assist others in fulfilling their dreams and make a few of my own come true. 

I believe I have found the perfect place to launch my career, Weichert Realtors® - Peak Performance. This office is one of the best in the entire Phoenix valley, in my opinion, for the following reasons; Nationwide support, training, market research and marketing tools, packaged with a family run business which provides one on one intimate service to our clients and customers.

Weichert Realtors® - Peak Performance prides itself in providing expert services for all our clients needs through our Gold Services program where we provide access to General Contractors, painters, roofers and every other service necessary to prepare your house for sale or make it even better after you move in.

Kandis Rausch,eXp Realty in Arizona,"My name is Kandis Rausch, and I am a customer-friendly real estate agent in Phoenix, Arizona. I represent the best interests of home buyers and sellers in the Phoenix area with passion and empathy. 

I find joy in helping people in any situation. I adopted this principle in my professional life as well. I have always been fascinated with real estate. Besides, I have accumulated vast knowledge in the industry, so I am a ‘connoisseur’ of the complex housing market. Throughout the years, I have never lost my integrity. 

For me, people come first and building meaningful relationships with my clients.  My dedication and empathy for my clients date to the beginning of my career. At that time, I realized I wanted to help families through the home-buying process, which could sometimes be challenging. Additionally, I observed and studied my hometown’s economic growth with a conscious eye. 

Soon, I became an expert in several neighborhoods and cities, such as Phoenix, Glendale, Peoria, and Surprise, Arizona. Studying their ever-changing market trends became one of my hobbies. 

I know that starting a new chapter can be an ambitious (and often strenuous) project to undertake. However, my knowledge, professionalism, and integrity will take a huge burden and stress off your shoulders. I am passionate about my clients’ housing requirements and strive to address them all to my best capabilities.

Seeing my clients’ excitement about their future homes fills my heart with great pleasure. It’s an uplifting time in most people’s lives.  Being part of their adventure inspires me to excel at my job even more.

I am a Great Outdoors-enthusiast. For this reason, I adore camping, backpacking, hiking, and kayaking with my family.

Jim Lyster,Homesmart - Broker,"The Arizona HomeBuyer Advocate Program

""Focused Real Estate Exclusively for the Arizona Homebuyer""

If you are considering buying a home, you are most likely about to make the most important financial decision in your life.  Consider this...
 
When a Buyer calls a listing on the Internet or the phone number on a realty sign in front of a home they are interested in, they are speaking with the Seller's agent.
 
Does the Buyer really want the Seller's agent instructing and advising them on how to close the deal on their new home?  Can the Buyer really trust the Seller's agent to protect their interests throughout the purchase transaction?  Does the Buyer really believe the Seller's agent is motivated to get them the best possible deal on their new home?  Common sense would answer a resounding ""NO"" to all of these questions.  The Buyer needs to be FULLY represented by a specialist in the purchase of their new home without any conflict of interest.  Exclusive Buyer Representation is available for both existing re-sale and new-build homes with NO FEE to the Homebuyer.  On new-build homes, does the Buyer really want to deal with the builder on their own?  Do they believe the builder is looking out for their interests, including how much they will pay for their new home?
 
That is what the Advocate Homebuyer Program is all about.  It was developed by Jim Lyster, a licensed Arizona REALTOR® since 1998 and an Exclusive Buyer Representative.  Once Jim got into the business, it became clear that the Buyer was often left behind in the high pressure, ""just get it sold"" mentality of listing and selling real estate.  Buyers were left with many un-answered questions and always felt as if no one was on their side.  The need for an entirely different approach to buying a home was seen as an opportunity for change.  Jim does not list property for sale or represent Seller's in any way.  This approach provides absolutely no conflict of interest or high pressure for the Buyer.

Mary McCormick,,"My roots go deep in the beautiful Grand Canyon State of Arizona. Born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona I come from a Certified Pioneer Family of  Arizona. Living in various parts of Arizona has afforded me the opportunity of watching Arizona grow from the Saguaro cacti of the metropolitan cities of Surprise and Casa Grande to the tall Ponderosa Pines of the Rim Country and Flagstaff.  Raising my children in Pine, Arizona for over twenty years is where I first earned my real estate license in 1999. 

Believing one should give back to the community, I served in the Scouting program for several years and finished my term as a Neighborhood Director over all the leaders. I’ve coached Little League, soccer, and football, and also facilitated United Blood Services drives in my community. As a frequent visitor to the copper mine country of Eastern Arizona and Greenlee county, I'd visit my Grandmother and Uncles. This is the beautiful country where Geronimo hid out from the Calvary.

I moved to the Phoenix metropolitan area in 2004 and rose to the top 1% of 1,800 agents for a national real estate company during Arizona's real estate market boom in 2004 and 2005.  Surviving the downturn for the next several years by opening a new real estate office focusing on the niche market in short sales and starting a property management division for my then broker.

Acquiring my Brokers license,  I facilitated a project manager in bringing back a 12-unit apartment complex from the brink of condemnation. The neglect of the property led to “urban blight” and a high crime rate at the downtown Chandler property.  All of that was changed!  To encourage tenancy and a sense of belonging, each unit was refurbished.  A thriving community garden was planted and monthly socials are held with BBQs and harvests from the garden. Weekly bible studies were offered.  I also volunteered at my child’s elementary school in the district's Art Masterpiece Program whose goal is to keep the arts alive and introduce their appreciation of them to the next generation.

Relationships are what real estate is all about. I've built strong ties to local community support programs and churches; giving back to the community comes naturally.

Bonnie Mueller,Realty ONE Group AZ,"In today’s highly competitive and frenetic housing market, award-winning real estate professional and interior designer, Bonnie Mueller, has the much sought-after real estate knowledge and home staging expertise that you definitely want working for you!
Known by her many loyal and happy clients as “passionate,” “meticulous,” and above all, a “highly-skilled negotiator,” Bonnie’s wonderful combination of real estate knowledge, talent, and experience have made her one of the most respected and successful agents. 
Bonnie is known for her exceptionally high standards of ethics and integrity in all of her business dealings and client relationships. She has a very strong background in both sales and marketing and knows exactly how to utilize today’s modern technology and social media to successfully market and sell her clients’ homes. Not all agents today can say that.
Bonnie has a very strong, personal understanding of the challenging relocation process because she moved from Chicago to Scottsdale back in 1998, and before that, moved to the U.S. from Poland. Bonnie is fluent in both Polish and English. Has established solid relationships with an international clientele.
On a personal note, Bonnie possesses a very fun, friendly, and down-to-earth style that makes her a true pleasure to work with. She enjoys cooking, gardening, travel, and is definitely a dog lover!
Born and raised in Poland, Bonnie proudly credits her father with teaching her everything she knows about offering excellent customer service and treating people with the utmost respect. Her father owned a very successful family business in Poland for many years where she saw from a young age that all of her dad’s clients quickly became his friends. That was just how things went – a happy, satisfied client eventually became a trusted friend. And the same is true for Bonnie and her clients today.
Bonnie also has a very strong, fighting spirit and a profound love and appreciation for life itself. 
She takes nothing for granted. She believes that there is something to look forward to every single day and that one’s home and family should be cherished every day - which explains why working with people to find the homes of their dreams appeals to Bonnie so much.
“As a trusted, personal real estate advisor, I guide my clients every step of the way and help them to make their real estate transactions as pleasant and hassle-free as possible. When my clients are happy and settled into their new homes, I’m even happier!” – Bonnie Mueller
