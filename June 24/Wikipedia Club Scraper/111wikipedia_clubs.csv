V.[1],,,"Mit der Wiederaufnahme des allgemeinen Fußballbetriebs in Berlin wurde Sparta im August 1918 dem Ostkreis des VBB zugeordnet. Darauf schlossen sich im Februar und April 1919 viele Spieler erneut dem Verein an, die zuvor bereits in der MSV aktiv waren. Es folgte ein kurzzeitiger Zusammenschluss mit dem SV Wacker 05, nach dessen Lösung Sparta den VBB verließ.[3][4] Nach einem Zusammenschluss mit dem Lichtenberger FC 1914 wechselte man als Arbeiterverein 1920 unter dem Namen SC Sparta 1911 Lichtenberg wieder zur Märkischen Spiel-Vereinigung und nahm an den Meisterschaften des ATSB teil. 1924 fanden weitere Vereinigungen mit den Berliner Sportfreunden und mit Fichte Ost zur Sptvg. Sparta 1911 Lichtenberg statt. In einer Sport-Beilage des Vorwärts wurde für den Straßenlauf „Rund um Friedrichshain“ am 28. September 1924 geworben, bei dem es eine Jugend- und eine Männerstaffel gab sowie ein Werbefußballspiel auf dem Sportplatz Kynaststraße.[5] Nach dem Ausschluss aus dem ATSB gründete man 1928 mit weiten Teilen des regionalen Verbands, der Märkischen Spiel-Vereinigung, die KPD-nahe Kampfgemeinschaft für Rote Sporteinheit (Rotsport). Hier nahm der Verein wieder den alten Namen SC Sparta 1911 Lichtenberg an. Von 1927 bis 1931 wurde Sparta fünfmal Meister des MSV-Ostkreises. In der 1931 erstmals ausgetragenen Reichsmeisterschaft des Rotsports erreichte Sparta nach 2:0-Sieg über Horst Heßler Gelsenkirchen das Finale. Gegen den DSV 1910 unterlagen die Berliner jedoch mit 2:3. Zuvor hatte man 1931 die MSV-Meisterschaft und anschließend nach einem 3:1-Sieg bei Hansa Rastenburg aus Ostpreußen und gegen den SV Weser 08 Bremen auswärts mit einem 3:3 und zu Hause mit einem 3:1 die Norddeutsche Meisterschaft des Rotsports gewonnen. In dem Mehrspartenverein Sparta waren seinerzeit mehrere bekannte Antifaschisten aktiv, darunter Werner Seelenbinder, Felix Tucholla, Hans Zoschke und Erwin Nöldner. Mit dem beginnenden Nationalsozialismus wurde Sparta am 14. Juli 1933 zwangsaufgelöst und das Vereinsvermögen beschlagnahmt. Daraufhin gründeten die Arbeitersportler zur Tarnung den neuen Verein SC Empor Lichtenberg.[6][7] Empor startete zunächst in der 2. Kreisklasse von Groß-Berlin im Ostkreis (Staffel D) und konnte sich im Laufe der Jahre bis in die Bezirksklasse hochspielen. Trotz des Krieges sollte am 29. Juni 1941 ein Jubiläumsspiel zum 30. Jahr des Bestehens zwischen Empor Lichtenberg und Union Oberschöneweide, dem Gaumeister von 1940, stattfinden. Das Spiel wurde allerdings wegen einer kurzfristig angesetzten Begegnung von Union im Tschammerpokal abgesagt, weshalb Empor ersatzweise gegen den Spandauer SV spielte und 3:5 verlor. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt befanden sich 110 Mitglieder des Vereins im Kriegsdienst bei der Wehrmacht, darunter die gesamte Erste Mannschaft von 1939.[8] Im Jahr 1943 bildete man mit dem Lichtenberger Ballspiel Club 09 eine Kriegsspielgemeinschaft, deren letzte bekannte Ansetzung gegen den SC Olymp auf den 1. Oktober 1944 datiert.",,"",,,,no stadium

Il decennio, nella stagione 1980-1981, si apre con Alberto Lazzerini ancora in panchina. Sarà tuttavia l'ultimo anno per il tecnico di Rosignano sulla panchina biancorossa prima di un clamoroso quanto fortunato ritorno nel 1985. Nelle successive due stagioni la Cuoiopelli vedrà avvicendarsi in panchina tre allenatori, i quali, in modo diverso, sapranno regalare soddisfazioni ai tifosi. Prima Sergio Orlandi e poi Paolo Battaglioli, conducono la “Cuoio” a sfiorate la C2 arrivando seconda dietro ad un Pontedera da record. L'anno dopo (1982-1983) i biancorossi, con Danilo Nencetti in panchina, sono autori di una fantastica cavalcata in Coppa Italia Dilettanti (dove molti meriti vanno ascritti all'allenatore in seconda Battaglioli). In finale la Cuoiopelli viene battuta dalla Lodigiani, a Montecatini Terme, su autogol. Al termine della stagione 1983-1984 una nuova svolta. Su pressione di Adamo Puccini la Cuoiopelli decide di investire pesantemente nel vivaio. Viene stretto un accordo pluriennale con il Torino di Luciano Moggi e dell'avvocato Nizzola e così la “Cuoio” diventa la società di riferimento del club granata per tutta la Toscana. Il settore giovanile biancorosso diventa così uno dei più importanti della regione e saprà sfornare talenti assoluti come Carlo Caramelli (Catanzaro, Ternana), Cristiano Scalabrelli (Fiorentina, Napoli, Lucchese), Massimiliano Allegri (Pisa, Pescara, Cagliari), Maurizio Poli (Reggina, Cagliari), David Balleri (Parma, Sampdoria, Lecce, Livorno) e Cristiano Lucarelli (Lecce, Torino, Livorno, Parma), di fatto ultimo grande prodotto del vivaio della “Cuoio”, ceduto nel 1993 al Perugia per una cifra milionaria. Anche in società si assiste ad un parziale rinnovamento con l'ingresso di alcuni nuovi dirigenti tra cui Maurizio Stefanelli. Sul campo le cose vanno male per due stagioni, in particolare nell'annata 1984/85 la Cuoiopelli parte con grandi ambizioni ma presto il campionato si rivelerà avaro di soddisfazioni e il tecnico Alessandro Bianchi (che poi farà fortuna come responsabile del settore giovanile della Lucchese) paga per tutti. L'anno successivo però la dirigenza decide che la C2 non può più sfuggire alla Cuoiopelli. Mario Brotini, direttore generale della società ormai da molti anni, punta sul ritorno di Alberto Lazzerini in panchina, mentre lo scambio Caramelli-Da Mommio prima suscita qualche perplessità ma poi risulterà vincente. Torna un cavallo di razza come Favarin, mentre Mirko Tinucci assicura estro e fantasia alla manovra biancorossa. Solo il Migliarina La Spezia, allenata proprio dall'ex allenatore Bianchi, tiene il passo della Cuoio ma la vittoria nello scontro diretto al “Picco” (rete decisiva di Donati) spiana la strada allo storico approdo nei professionisti. Si apre così il secondo trionfale ciclo di Lazzerini in panchina, che proseguirà anche in C2. Dopo un anno di transizione, infatti, nel 1987-1988 la Cuoiopelli sarà autrice di un grande campionato arrivando terza in campionato e sfiorando la C1, categoria a cui invece saranno ammesse Carrarese e Montevarchi. Lazzerini lascerà definitivamente Santa Croce nel 1989. Sarà il canto del cigno di un grande ciclo con un campionato di sofferenza ma culminato con la salvezza. Gli anni '80 si concluderanno con il ritorno nei dilettanti al termine della stagione 1989-1990, dove sulla panchina biancorossa si avvicendano Idilio Cei e Lucio Mujesan.",https://it-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Coppa_Italia_Dilettanti?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-GB,"",,,,no stadium
