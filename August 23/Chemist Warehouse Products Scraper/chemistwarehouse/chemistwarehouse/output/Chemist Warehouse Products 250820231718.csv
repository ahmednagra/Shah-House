1.    Always wash hands before preparing formula and ensure that formula is prepared in a clean area. Wash and sterilise all utensils by boiling for 5 minutes or using an approved sterilising agent 

2.    Boil safe drinking water and allow it to cool until lukewarm. Pour the correct amount of previously boiled (now cooled) water into a sterilised bottle.

3.    Fill the measuring scoop with formula powder, tap it gently to remove air pockets and level off using the levelling edge on the can.

4.    After the appropriate number of scoops of powder have been added to the water place the teat and cap on the bottle and shake gently until the powder dissolves.

5.    Test the temperature of the milk with a few drops on the inside of your wrist – it should feel just warm, but cool is better than too hot. Feed immediately – any formula left at the end of the feed must be discarded

4.    After the appropriate number of scoops of powder have been added to the water place the teat and cap on the bottle and shake gently until the powder dissolves.

5.    Test the temperature of the milk with a few drops on the inside of your wrist – it should feel just warm, but cool is better than too hot. Feed immediately – any formula left at the end of the feed must be discarded

The Twist & Click nappy bin is the only nappy bin to twist and individually wrap each nappy, safely sealing away odours and germs, keeping your home tidy and odour-free. The multi-layer, anti-bacterial GREENFILM is 100x more effective than nappy sacks as it is Biomaster** protected to kill 99% of dangerous germs like E-coli and Staphylococcus Aureus. On contact it stops proteins being broken down by bacteria, a process responsible for lots of nasty smells. The smart sealing lid encloses all unpleasant odours and the inbuilt plunger pushes nappies deep into the bin, keeping your hands clean. Despite its compact size, this nappy bin can hold up to 28 nappies* at once, meaning fewer trips to the outside bin. The nappy bin comes with one pre-loaded refill cassette. Each refill provides enough anti-bacterial film to wrap up to 1 month's worth* of nappies depending on the size and number you use.

Please note that the Twist & Click nappy disposal system is only compatible with the Tommee Tippee Twist & Click refills. Sangenic TEC & Simplee Sangenic refill cassettes are not compatible with this bin. For optimum performance we only recommend using original Twist & Click branded refill cassettes in your Twist & Click nappy bin. *Based on using size 1 nappies (2-5kg) ** Antibacterial protection is present in the film and not the other components of this product. Film is treated with Biomaster silver biocide tested to ISO 22196-2011. Please use biocides responsibly

Mama, you are doing an amazing job! You have grown your beautiful baby, given birth and now you are nourishing your precious little one through breastfeeding. As you hold, love and gaze at your beautiful baby, you are passing on essential nutrients and immune factors through your milk. Your own well-being matters too, and we want to support you. There are nutrients that have a significant impact on your own health, postnatal recovery and breastfeeding such as iron, zinc and Omega 3 Fatty acids. They can easily be obtained through eating a nutritious breakfast.

Created by the renowned and respected International Lactation Expert – Pinky McKay, alongside a team of nutrition professionals, Boobie Brekkie, our delicious all natural, toasted muesli is packed with essential nutrients that are important for postnatal recovery and a healthy milk supply. Boobie Brekkie is intentionally made as close to nature as possible. We use only all natural, whole food ingredients with no artificial preservatives or additives. Boobie Brekkie is dairy, wheat, egg, yeast and sulphate free, vegan and rich in Omega 3 Fatty Acids that are important for your baby’s brain development and your own wellbeing. As your baby is exposed to foods through your own breastmilk, with Boobie Brekkie, you can be sure that whilst you are nourishing your own body, you are also providing your baby with the purest delight of all.

Remember, you cannot fill from an empty cup, compliment your supply of Boobie Bikkies with our new Boobie Brekkie - the perfect new addition to your breakfast routine – making it even easier for you to nourish yourself while you nourish your baby.

Our Boobie Brekkie is a mix of whole oats, coconut flakes, sunflower, pumpkin and golden flax seeds toasted in coconut oil and rice malt syrup flavoured with cranberry, apple and vanilla.

INTERESTING FACT: Our Brekkie is packed with flaxseed providing you with a good source of Omega 3 which is particularly important for your baby's brain development. In addition, with a gorgeous vanilla aroma your baby will love it too. Studies have shown that babies suckle longer and obtain more milk when milk is vanilla flavoured (Mennella JA. Mothers milk: a medium for early flavour experiences.J.Hum Lact).

So, when you need to turn screams and sobs into smiles and sleep, simply pick up a Tommee Tippee Fun Style soother.
Our soother packs feature a reusable steriliser pod that can be used to effectively and efficiently sterilise up to 2 soothers at once in a microwave, killing up to 99.9% of bacteria.
Our orthodontic* Fun Style soothers feature an oval, reverse ortho baglet that is vented meaning it compresses more easily than traditional, air-filled baglets and therefore reduces pressure on baby's developing teeth and gums. The symmetrical, soft silicone baglet that is fully reversible and has no 'wrong' side-up so the soother will always be placed correctly in your baby's mouth, even when baby puts the soother in their mouth themselves.
The curved shield sits comfortably between baby's chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby's delicate skin against irritation.
The easy to clean, BPA-free silicone baglet is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. We recommend that you replace the soother every month and always at the first signs of damage or wear. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months
To help reduce our environmental impact we have redesigned our soother packaging. Free from single-use plastic, our soothers are packaged in 100% recyclable cardboard.
*as compared to traditional round unvented soothers which do not compress as easily.

**99% of mums would recommend a Tommee Tippee soother
**97% of mums say a Tommee Tippee soother helped settle baby
**93% of mums say babies love their Tommee Tippee soother

Dr Browns Product Information: Our Dr. Browns BPA Free bottle features a patented two-piece internal vent system that works unlike any other bottle design.

The vent system fully vents our bottle for vacuum-free feeding, which we call positive-pressure flow, similar to breast feeding.

As the baby feeds, air is channelled from the teat collar through the vent system, bypassing the breast milk or formula, to the back of the bottle.

Air never mixes with the breast milk or formula which minimises oxidation and helps maintain essential nutrients like vitamins C, A and E. B

abies feed more comfortably because the vent system allows them to nurse without fighting the negative effects of a vacuum or the discomfort of ingesting air bubbles.

This helps to reduce feeding problems like colic, burping, and wind. The breast milk or formula flows freely, without teat collapse.

So, when you need to turn screams and sobs into smiles and sleep, simply pick up a Tommee Tippee Fun Style soother.
Our soother packs feature a reusable steriliser pod that can be used to effectively and efficiently sterilise up to 2 soothers at once in a microwave, killing up to 99.9% of bacteria.
Our orthodontic* Fun Style soothers feature an oval, reverse ortho baglet that is vented meaning it compresses more easily than traditional, air-filled baglets and therefore reduces pressure on baby's developing teeth and gums. The symmetrical, soft silicone baglet that is fully reversible and has no 'wrong' side-up so the soother will always be placed correctly in your baby's mouth, even when baby puts the soother in their mouth themselves.
The curved shield sits comfortably between baby's chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby's delicate skin against irritation.
The easy to clean, BPA-free silicone baglet is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. We recommend that you replace the soother every month and always at the first signs of damage or wear. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months
To help reduce our environmental impact we have redesigned our soother packaging. Free from single-use plastic, our soothers are packaged in 100% recyclable cardboard.

WARNING! 
Inspect carefully before each use. Pull the soother in all directions. Throw away at the first signs of damage or weakness 
Only use dedicated soother holders tested to EN 12586. Never attach other ribbons or cords to a soother, your child may be strangled by them. 
Decorations shall not be added to dummies as they may detach and the child could choke on them.
Pins, ribbons or string shall not be attached to any part of the dummy (I.e. around the ring, plug or through the ventilation holes) as these can be strangulation hazards. Strangulation hazards include the cutting off of blood supply to fingers and limbs.
In the event that the dummy becomes lodged in the mouth, DO NOT PANIC; it cannot be swallowed and is designed to cope with such an event. Remove from the mouth with care and as gently as possible.
Replace the dummy after one month, for safety and hygiene reasons.",,,,84110,"https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/84110/2DF_800.jpg,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/84110/2DB_800.jpg,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/84110/ADD4_800.jpg,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/84110/ADD5_800.jpg,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/84110/ADD6_800.jpg,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/84110/ADD7_800.jpg,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/84110/ADD8_800.jpg"

NUK has developed a baby bottle cleanser that is based on natural ingredients and contains specific enzymes which effectively remove milk protein, pulp and juice residues. Its mild formula makes it 'baby safe'. Simply add the NUK Baby Bottle Cleanser to a little warm water, and wash your baby's bottles, teats and accessories thoroughly, then simply rinse away. The NUK Bottle Cleanser has a thin consistency making it disperse quickly. The leftover proteins are cracked open by the enzymes and can be easily rinsed away. NUK Baby Bottle cleanser is free of scents and colourants.",,"NUK Baby Bottle Cleanser for teats and bottles, free of scents and colourants.
The NUK Bottle Cleanser was specially developed for cleaning baby products. The formulation is based on natural ingredients. With the help of enzymes, milk, puree and juice in particular can be reliably removed. NUK Bottle Cleanser is so mild that you can not only clean baby bottles and teats, cups, plates and cutlery, but also breast pump parts, as well as washable toys and other objects that come in contact with your baby’s mouth – without a second thought.


How does the NUK Baby Bottle Cleanser work?
In the first months of life, a baby’s food is first and foremost milk and puree. After feeding, leftovers remain on bottles, teats, cups and plates and germs, bacteria and bad smells can build up there. The NUK Bottle Cleanser is so gentle because we have done without any ingredients that are not necessary for cleaning off baby food. Instead, the NUK Bottle Cleanser contains enzymes which are particularly effective on milk proteins and thickeners. In nature too, in the digestive system for example, enzymes help to break down and dissolve proteins. The formulation of the new bottle cleanser is based on this example from nature. Thanks to its thin consistency, the cleanser disperses quickly. The leftover proteins are cracked open by the enzymes and can be easily rinsed away completely.",,106020,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/106020/F2D_800.jpg

The new vent system is designed to grow with baby, and we recommend using this system to experience all the health benefits of our bottle. It helps reduce feeding problems, helps digestion and helps preserve vitamins. Some moms and dads find removing the vent a convenient option as their baby's feeding becomes more developed. The nipple venting creates a paced flow, and provides a feeding experience similar to most nipple-vented bottles. Options bottles fit most breast pumps, and are BPA-free. This innovative bottle effectively and efficiently covers all parents' needs. Dr. Brown's Options grows with the needs of your baby and offers healthy benefits whether your little one is experiencing feeding challenges or not. Options gives you the power of choice.

Dr. Browns BPA Free bottle features a patented two-piece internal vent system that works unlike any other bottle design. The vent system fully vents our bottle for vacuum-free feeding, which we call positive-pressure flow, similar to breast feeding. As the baby feeds, air is channelled from the teat collar through the vent system, bypassing the breast milk or formula, to the back of the bottle. Air never mixes with the breast milk or formula which minimises oxidation and helps maintain essential nutrients like vitamins C, A and E. Babies feed more comfortably because the vent system allows them to nurse without fighting the negative effects of a vacuum or the discomfort of ingesting air bubbles. This helps to reduce feeding problems like colic, burping, and wind. The breast milk or formula flows freely, without teat collapse. No vacuum, no bubbles, no teat Collapse!

Health Benefits

A first-of-its-kind university study to measure nutrient levels in breast milk and formula during a typical 20-minute feeding determined that Dr Brown's fully vented bottles help maintain levels of important nutrients like vitamins C, A & E.

Helps maintain vitamins C, A & E: Patented internal vent system is proven to minimize oxidation of breastmilk and formula, to help maintain essential nutrients. Positive-pressure feeding: Fully vented bottle design provides vacuum-free feeding similar to breast feeding.

Helps reduce colic: Vent system eliminates negative pressure and air bubbles to help reduce colic, burping and wind.",,,"Dr. Brown's bottles are made of BPA-free polypropylene plastic or BPA-free borosilicate glass. All components of the Dr. Brown's bottle, including the vent insert, vent reservoir, travel disk, nipple collar, and cap are also BPA-free polypropylene.

Made from polyphenylsulfone (PPSU), a medical grade, naturally amber-toned plastic, these baby bottles are highly durable, and heat-resistant and won't retain odours or stains left behind by breast milk or formula. Due to the highly resilient nature of the bottle material, these baby bottles are ideal for regular use and can withstand frequent sterilisation.
Made from super soft, resilient silicone, this bottle teat features a matt texture that feels closer to skin for complete comfort at feeding time. Designed with breastfeeding experts, our baby bottle teats are shaped like a breast because babies prefer it that way. The patented ripple design allows the teat to mimic the natural flex, stretch and movement of a mum's breast to support in the transition between breast and bottle.
Featuring an Easi-vent valve that reduces excessive air flow, so little ones ingest more milk and less air, preventing symptoms of colic. Together with the bottle's sensitive valve, the wide bottle neck encourages your baby's intuitive feeding action. Designed to be held in the most natural position during feeding, the compact shape of the bottle also allows baby to be closer to you.
The wide neck bottle makes cleaning easy, and the bottles are suitable for use in the dishwasher, microwave and steam sterilisers. Simply unscrew your baby bottle into three parts for easy cleaning and sterilising.
Which flow rate do I need?
We offer different flow rates to keep up with your growing baby. Every baby is different but as a guide we suggest slow flow for 0+months, medium flow for 3+ months and fast flow for 6+ months. Closer to Nature teats are only compatible with Closer to Nature bottles.
How often should I replace the bottle teats?
We recommend changing your bottle teats every two months. And you should change them immediately if they're damaged, weak or have been bitten by tiny teeth.

Suitable For:  months

Warnings

      
For your child's safety and health
WARNING!
Always use this product with adult supervision. Accidents have occurred when babies have been left alone with drinking equipment due to the baby falling or if the product has disassembled.
Never use feeding teats/nipples (delete as appropriate) as a soother/pacifier (delete as appropriate). 
Continuous and prolonged sucking of fluids will cause tooth decay. Tooth decay in young children can occur even when non-sweetened fluids are used. This can occur if the baby is allowed to use the bottle for long periods through the day and particularly through the night, when saliva flow is reduced or if it is used as a soother/pacifier (delete as appropriate).
Always check food temperature before feeding. Heating in a microwave oven may produce localised high temperatures. Take extra care when microwave heating. Always stir heated food to ensure even heat distribution and test the temperature before serving.",,,,88197,"https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/88197/2DF_800.jpg,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/88197/2DB_800.jpg,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/88197/ADD3_800.jpg,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/88197/ADD4_800.jpg,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/88197/ADD5_800.jpg,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/88197/ADD6_800.jpg,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/88197/ADD7_800.jpg"

Backed by over 60 years of research into baby’s natural sucking behaviour, the new upgraded Pigeon SofTouch Nursing Bottles launched in 2022 come with research-based latch-on line for appropriate latching, and even softer nipple that is closest to mother’s breast.

Developed to functionally mimic the feeding movements that babies perform when drinking from mum’s breasts, SofTouch Baby Bottles are crafted to especially support breastfeeding mums to feed their baby from both breast and bottle seamlessly.

Anti-colic with advanced air vent system that minimises swallowed air as baby drinks. Have more peace of mind and enjoy the treasured moments with your little one!

The opening of the nipple is round-cut which allows milk to flow out consistently and gradually. Newborns have yet to develop any jaw muscles, thus the nipple is designed to support their sucking ability at this age.

For 3+ months and above. 300ml comes with M size nipple that has a Y-cut opening on the nipple. Compatible with SofTouch™ nipple.",,,,130035,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/130035/F2D_800.jpg

Keeping baby bottles clean is essential for baby's health. But let's face it, germs love kitchens and bottle washing is a part of (kitchen) life. Now there's a smart way to keep your trusty bottle cleaner safe from household germs.
The non-slip handle gives soapy hands a firm grip and the sturdy nylon bristles are tough on dirt, yet gentle on baby's bottles.  Since nobody has time for flinging soapy water around the kitchen, we even developed our bristles to reduce the dreaded splash-back when it pops out of the bottle opening. We know baby bottles come in all shapes and sizes so we added a new flexing neck to help get into every bottle with ease.
Just when you thought we couldn’t cram in any more features into such a small package- there's even a convenient soft rubber nipple brush inside the handle, making this brush equally suited for cleaning pump parts, valves, and other small bottle accessories, too. The Bristle™ Bottle Brush keeps your bottle cleaning routine sanitary and your sanity intact, so you only need to worry about the bottle parts, pots and pans you can see, not the dirty stuff you can't.
Standing baby bottle brush with suction cup base
Flexible neck reaches the corners of every bottle shape
Textured, easy-grip handle prevents slipping when wet
Bonus, soft rubber nipple brush in handle
Soft nylon bristles are durable, scratch-free, and reduce splash-back

The new vent system is designed to grow with baby, and we recommend using this system to experience all the health benefits of our bottle. It helps reduce feeding problems, helps digestion and helps preserve vitamins. Some moms and dads find removing the vent a convenient option as their baby’s feeding becomes more developed. The nipple venting creates a paced flow, and provides a feeding experience similar to most nipple-vented bottles. Options bottles fit most breast pumps, and are BPA-free. This innovative bottle effectively and efficiently covers all parents’ needs. Dr. Brown’s Options grows with the needs of your baby and offers healthy benefits whether your little one is experiencing feeding challenges or not. Options gives you the power of choice.

Dr. Browns BPA Free bottle features a patented two-piece internal vent system that works unlike any other bottle design. The vent system fully vents our bottle for vacuum-free feeding, which we call positive-pressure flow, similar to breast feeding. As the baby feeds, air is channelled from the teat collar through the vent system, bypassing the breast milk or formula, to the back of the bottle. Air never mixes with the breast milk or formula which minimises oxidation and helps maintain essential nutrients like vitamins C, A and E. Babies feed more comfortably because the vent system allows them to nurse without fighting the negative effects of a vacuum or the discomfort of ingesting air bubbles. This helps to reduce feeding problems like colic, burping, and wind. The breast milk or formula flows freely, without teat collapse. No vacuum, no bubbles, no teat Collapse!

Health Benefits

A first-of-its-kind university study to measure nutrient levels in breast milk and formula during a typical 20-minute feeding determined that Dr Brown's fully vented bottles help maintain levels of important nutrients like vitamins C, A & E.

Helps maintain vitamins C, A & E: Patented internal vent system is proven to minimize oxidation of breastmilk and formula, to help maintain essential nutrients. Positive-pressure feeding: Fully vented bottle design provides vacuum-free feeding similar to breast feeding.

Helps reduce colic: Vent system eliminates negative pressure and air bubbles to help reduce colic, burping and wind.",,,"Dr. Brown's bottles are made of BPA-free polypropylene plastic or BPA-free borosilicate glass.

So, when you need to turn screams and sobs into smiles and sleep, simply pick up a Tommee Tippee Anytime soother.
Our soother packs feature a reusable steriliser pod that can be used to effectively and efficiently sterilise up to 2 soothers at once in a microwave, killing up to 99.9% of bacteria.
Our orthodontic* Anytime soothers feature an oval, reverse ortho baglet that is vented meaning it compresses more easily than traditional, air-filled baglets and therefore reduces pressure on baby's developing teeth and gums. The symmetrical, soft silicone baglet that is fully reversible and has no 'wrong' side-up so the soother will always be placed correctly in your baby's mouth, even when baby puts the soother in their mouth themselves.
The curved shield sits comfortably between baby's chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby's delicate skin against irritation.
The easy to clean, BPA-free silicone baglet is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. We recommend that you replace the soother every month and always at the first signs of damage or wear. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months
To help reduce our environmental impact we have redesigned our soother packaging. Free from single-use plastic, our soothers are packaged in 100% recyclable cardboard.

This cup also comes with a handy removable hygiene cover.

The new vent system is designed to grow with baby, and we recommend using this system to experience all the health benefits of our bottle. It helps reduce feeding problems, helps digestion and helps preserve vitamins. Some moms and dads find removing the vent a convenient option as their baby’s feeding becomes more developed. The nipple venting creates a paced flow, and provides a feeding experience similar to most nipple-vented bottles. Options bottles fit most breast pumps, and are BPA-free. This innovative bottle effectively and efficiently covers all parents’ needs. Dr. Brown’s Options grows with the needs of your baby and offers healthy benefits whether your little one is experiencing feeding challenges or not. Options gives you the power of choice.

Dr. Browns BPA Free bottle features a patented two-piece internal vent system that works unlike any other bottle design. The vent system fully vents our bottle for vacuum-free feeding, which we call positive-pressure flow, similar to breast feeding. As the baby feeds, air is channelled from the teat collar through the vent system, bypassing the breast milk or formula, to the back of the bottle. Air never mixes with the breast milk or formula which minimises oxidation and helps maintain essential nutrients like vitamins C, A and E. Babies feed more comfortably because the vent system allows them to nurse without fighting the negative effects of a vacuum or the discomfort of ingesting air bubbles. This helps to reduce feeding problems like colic, burping, and wind. The breast milk or formula flows freely, without teat collapse. No vacuum, no bubbles, no teat Collapse!

Health Benefits

A first-of-its-kind university study to measure nutrient levels in breast milk and formula during a typical 20-minute feeding determined that Dr Brown's fully vented bottles help maintain levels of important nutrients like vitamins C, A & E.

Helps maintain vitamins C, A & E: Patented internal vent system is proven to minimize oxidation of breastmilk and formula, to help maintain essential nutrients. Positive-pressure feeding: Fully vented bottle design provides vacuum-free feeding similar to breast feeding.

Helps reduce colic: Vent system eliminates negative pressure and air bubbles to help reduce colic, burping and wind.",,,"Dr. Brown's bottles are made of BPA-free polypropylene plastic or BPA-free borosilicate glass.

The new vent system is designed to grow with baby, and we recommend using this system to experience all the health benefits of our bottle. It helps reduce feeding problems, helps digestion and helps preserve vitamins. Some moms and dads find removing the vent a convenient option as their baby’s feeding becomes more developed. The nipple venting creates a paced flow, and provides a feeding experience similar to most nipple-vented bottles. Options bottles fit most breast pumps, and are BPA-free. This innovative bottle effectively and efficiently covers all parents’ needs. Dr. Brown’s Options grows with the needs of your baby and offers healthy benefits whether your little one is experiencing feeding challenges or not. Options gives you the power of choice.

Dr. Browns BPA Free bottle features a patented two-piece internal vent system that works unlike any other bottle design. The vent system fully vents our bottle for vacuum-free feeding, which we call positive-pressure flow, similar to breast feeding. As the baby feeds, air is channelled from the teat collar through the vent system, bypassing the breast milk or formula, to the back of the bottle. Air never mixes with the breast milk or formula which minimises oxidation and helps maintain essential nutrients like vitamins C, A and E. Babies feed more comfortably because the vent system allows them to nurse without fighting the negative effects of a vacuum or the discomfort of ingesting air bubbles. This helps to reduce feeding problems like colic, burping, and wind. The breast milk or formula flows freely, without teat collapse. No vacuum, no bubbles, no teat Collapse!

Health Benefits

A first-of-its-kind university study to measure nutrient levels in breast milk and formula during a typical 20-minute feeding determined that Dr Brown's fully vented bottles help maintain levels of important nutrients like vitamins C, A & E.

Helps maintain vitamins C, A & E: Patented internal vent system is proven to minimize oxidation of breastmilk and formula, to help maintain essential nutrients. Positive-pressure feeding: Fully vented bottle design provides vacuum-free feeding similar to breast feeding.

Helps reduce colic: Vent system eliminates negative pressure and air bubbles to help reduce colic, burping and wind.",,,"Dr. Brown's bottles are made of BPA-free polypropylene plastic or BPA-free borosilicate glass. All components of the Dr. Brown's bottle, including the vent insert, vent reservoir, travel disk, nipple collar, and cap are also BPA-free polypropylene.

Made from polyphenylsulfone (PPSU), a medical grade, naturally amber-toned plastic, these baby bottles are highly durable, and heat-resistant and won't retain odours or stains left behind by breast milk or formula. Due to the highly resilient nature of the bottle material, these baby bottles are ideal for regular use and can withstand frequent sterilisation. Made from super soft, resilient silicone, this bottle teat features a matt texture that feels closer to skin for complete comfort at feeding time. Designed with breastfeeding experts, our baby bottle teats are shaped like a breast because babies prefer it that way. The patented ripple design allows the teat to mimic the natural flex, stretch and movement of a mum's breast to support in the transition between breast and bottle. Featuring an Easi-vent valve that reduces excessive air flow, so little ones ingest more milk and less air, preventing symptoms of colic. Together with the bottle's sensitive valve, the wide bottle neck encourages your baby's intuitive feeding action. Designed to be held in the most natural position during feeding, the compact shape of the bottle also allows baby to be closer to you. The wide neck bottle makes cleaning easy, and the bottles are suitable for use in the dishwasher, microwave and steam sterilisers. Simply unscrew your baby bottle into three parts for easy cleaning and sterilising. Which flow rate do I need? We offer different flow rates to keep up with your growing baby. Every baby is different but as a guide we suggest slow flow for 0+months, medium flow for 3+ months and fast flow for 6+ months. Closer to Nature teats are only compatible with Closer to Nature bottles. How often should I replace the bottle teats? We recommend changing your bottle teats every two months. And you should change them immediately if they're damaged, weak or have been bitten by tiny teeth.

How do you clean Medela Solo™?

To clean Medela Solo™ follow the same procedures as for the Swing Flex™ breast pump. Solo™ is quick and easy to disassemble and clean. You can wash the components (except for the tubing) manually or use the dishwasher.For further information and instructions on how to clean and sanitise the tubing, please read our Instructions for use.

How do you sterilise a Medela Solo™ pump?

Sterilising and sanitising are two different things that sound similar. Sterilisation is a procedure that can only be performed in a special lab, normally this happens for hospital products. Sanitising can be done at home. It is easy to sanitise your Medela Solo™, follow the same simple steps as for Swing Flex™ breast pump: cover the disassembled, washed parts, except for the tubing, with water and boil at least for 5 minutes or use the microwaveable Medela Quick Clean™ bags . For further information and instructions on how to clean and sanitise the tubing, please read our Instructions for use.

Can I turn my single breast pump into a double?

Solo™ is a single electric breast pump. This means that its motor is not suitable for generating sufficient vacuum to extract milk from both breasts at the same time. If you express milk regularly and are interested in a double electric breast pump you should consider Medela's new Swing Maxi™.

Warnings

      
For your child's safety and health
WARNING!
Always use this product with adult supervision. Accidents have occurred when babies have been left alone with drinking equipment due to the baby falling or if the product has disassembled.
Never use feeding teats/nipples (delete as appropriate) as a soother/pacifier (delete as appropriate). 
Continuous and prolonged sucking of fluids will cause tooth decay. Tooth decay in young children can occur even when non-sweetened fluids are used.

The new PersonalFit Flex™ breast shield was developed with the help of a team of research scientists and breastfeeding mums.

Across more than 1,000 pumping sessions, they proved it delivered more comfort and efficiency.

With the Perfect Prep Day & Night machine, there's no more waiting around for the kettle to boil and for the water to cool. This dream machine delivers a fresh formula feed at body temperature in just two minutes! That's 10x faster than using a kettle! The Perfect Prep works with any brand of powdered formula milk and has an adjustable base to suit different bottle shapes and sizes. The sleep-friendly night-feed features including soft glow tank lights, bottle stand downlights and adjustable volume control make preparing those late-night feeds so much easier and quicker. Here's how to use it: Step 1: Use the display to select feed size from 4fl oz to 11fl oz, add your formula to the baby bottle and place bottle on the stand. Step 2: Press the power button to release an initial 'hot-shot' of water into your bottle. At 70°C, this kills bacteria that may be present in your formula and will also help to dissolve the powder. Step 3: Add milk lid to the bottle and shake well. Place your bottle back on the stand and press again to dispense the remaining cooler water. The result - a fresh bottle at body temperature ready to feed baby straight away. Your Perfect Prep Machine is designed for use with water straight from the tap. From the outside, the Perfect Prep antibacterial filter may look a lot like other water filters, but other filters may not contain the internal antibacterial membrane and that's what makes the difference. This filtration membrane is designed to remove bacteria, impurities and contaminants that can be found in water to ensure it's clean and safe just like boiled water from a kettle. Other standard water filters may not include this antibacterial system so these will NOT remove bacteria. When tested against other competitor water filters, our filter produced the clearest results. To be sure you're protected from bacteria, it's important you use our antibacterial filters in your machine. Please note that even if they vary in appearance, they'll work the same if they're Tommee Tippee branded.

KEY FEATURES
• Fast bottle preparation: The Perfect Prep machine delivers a fresh formula feed at body temperature in just two minutes! 10x faster than boiling water and waiting for it to cool
• Use with tap water: There is no need to use bottled or filtered water. Our antibacterial filter, with internal filtration membrane, removes bacteria, impurities and contaminants
• Easy to use: Add the formula to your baby's bottle, press the power button to release a hot shot of 70°C water that kills any bacteria in the formula, shake then press the button again to dispense cooler water
• Different feed sizes: Suitable for use with any brand of formula, the machine prepares the exact amount you need from 4fl oz to 11fl oz. The adjustable base suits different bottle shapes and sizes

The new vent system is designed to grow with baby, and we recommend using this system to experience all the health benefits of our bottle. It helps reduce feeding problems, helps digestion and helps preserve vitamins. Some moms and dads find removing the vent a convenient option as their baby’s feeding becomes more developed. The nipple venting creates a paced flow, and provides a feeding experience similar to most nipple-vented bottles. Options bottles fit most breast pumps, and are BPA-free. This innovative bottle effectively and efficiently covers all parents’ needs. Dr. Brown’s Options grows with the needs of your baby and offers healthy benefits whether your little one is experiencing feeding challenges or not. Options gives you the power of choice.

Dr. Browns BPA Free bottle features a patented two-piece internal vent system that works unlike any other bottle design. The vent system fully vents our bottle for vacuum-free feeding, which we call positive-pressure flow, similar to breast feeding. As the baby feeds, air is channelled from the teat collar through the vent system, bypassing the breast milk or formula, to the back of the bottle. Air never mixes with the breast milk or formula which minimises oxidation and helps maintain essential nutrients like vitamins C, A and E. Babies feed more comfortably because the vent system allows them to nurse without fighting the negative effects of a vacuum or the discomfort of ingesting air bubbles. This helps to reduce feeding problems like colic, burping, and wind. The breast milk or formula flows freely, without teat collapse. No vacuum, no bubbles, no teat Collapse!

Health Benefits

A first-of-its-kind university study to measure nutrient levels in breast milk and formula during a typical 20-minute feeding determined that Dr Brown's fully vented bottles help maintain levels of important nutrients like vitamins C, A & E.

Helps maintain vitamins C, A & E: Patented internal vent system is proven to minimize oxidation of breastmilk and formula, to help maintain essential nutrients. Positive-pressure feeding: Fully vented bottle design provides vacuum-free feeding similar to breast feeding.

Helps reduce colic: Vent system eliminates negative pressure and air bubbles to help reduce colic, burping and wind.",,,"Dr. Brown's bottles are made of BPA-free polypropylene plastic or BPA-free borosilicate glass. All components of the Dr. Brown's bottle, including the vent insert, vent reservoir, travel disk, nipple collar, and cap are also BPA-free polypropylene.

So, when you need to turn screams and sobs into smiles and sleep, simply pick up a Tommee Tippee Anytime soother.
Our soother packs feature a reusable steriliser pod that can be used to effectively and efficiently sterilise up to 2 soothers at once in a microwave, killing up to 99.9% of bacteria.
Our orthodontic* Anytime soothers feature an oval, reverse ortho baglet that is vented meaning it compresses more easily than traditional, air-filled baglets and therefore reduces pressure on baby's developing teeth and gums. The symmetrical, soft silicone baglet that is fully reversible and has no 'wrong' side-up so the soother will always be placed correctly in your baby's mouth, even when baby puts the soother in their mouth themselves.
The curved shield sits comfortably between baby's chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby's delicate skin against irritation.
The easy to clean, BPA-free silicone baglet is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. We recommend that you replace the soother every month and always at the first signs of damage or wear. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months
To help reduce our environmental impact we have redesigned our soother packaging. Free from single-use plastic, our soothers are packaged in 100% recyclable cardboard.

The new vent system is designed to grow with baby, and we recommend using this system to experience all the health benefits of our bottle. It helps reduce feeding problems, helps digestion and helps preserve vitamins. Some moms and dads find removing the vent a convenient option as their baby’s feeding becomes more developed. The nipple venting creates a paced flow, and provides a feeding experience similar to most nipple-vented bottles. Options bottles fit most breast pumps, and are BPA-free. This innovative bottle effectively and efficiently covers all parents’ needs. Dr. Brown’s Options grows with the needs of your baby and offers healthy benefits whether your little one is experiencing feeding challenges or not. Options gives you the power of choice.

Dr. Browns BPA Free bottle features a patented two-piece internal vent system that works unlike any other bottle design. The vent system fully vents our bottle for vacuum-free feeding, which we call positive-pressure flow, similar to breast feeding. As the baby feeds, air is channelled from the teat collar through the vent system, bypassing the breast milk or formula, to the back of the bottle. Air never mixes with the breast milk or formula which minimises oxidation and helps maintain essential nutrients like vitamins C, A and E. Babies feed more comfortably because the vent system allows them to nurse without fighting the negative effects of a vacuum or the discomfort of ingesting air bubbles. This helps to reduce feeding problems like colic, burping, and wind. The breast milk or formula flows freely, without teat collapse. No vacuum, no bubbles, no teat Collapse!

Health Benefits

A first-of-its-kind university study to measure nutrient levels in breast milk and formula during a typical 20-minute feeding determined that Dr Brown's fully vented bottles help maintain levels of important nutrients like vitamins C, A & E.

Helps maintain vitamins C, A & E: Patented internal vent system is proven to minimize oxidation of breastmilk and formula, to help maintain essential nutrients. Positive-pressure feeding: Fully vented bottle design provides vacuum-free feeding similar to breast feeding.

Helps reduce colic: Vent system eliminates negative pressure and air bubbles to help reduce colic, burping and wind.",,,"Dr. Brown's bottles are made of BPA-free polypropylene plastic or BPA-free borosilicate glass.

Convenient & Hygienic brush-tip applicator

The GAIA Natural Baby Cradle Cap Lotion features a soft, silicone brush tip applicator for hygienic application. Made from medical grade silicone that is easy to clean and quick-drying.

The brush tip applicator eliminates the need to purchase a separate brush to help loosen the scales associated with cradle cap, making it easy, gentle and convenient.

Cradle cap is a form of dermatitis that causes inflammation of the oil glands in the skin, which are called the sebaceous glands.

This specific type of dermatitis is called seborrheic dermatitis. Sebaceous glands help 'waterproof' the skin by creating a slightly greasy substance called sebum.

Babies are born with large, over-active sebaceous glands which shrink over time - cradle cap is often the result of these glands in overdrive due to the hormones from childbirth.

Cradle cap is most common in infants between 2 - 12 weeks of age, but can occur up until they are 12 months old.","A gentle Cradle Cap Lotion enriched with organic Calendula and organic Chamomile to help remove flakes associated with cradle cap. Featuring a soft, silicone built-in brush tip for added convenience! Dermatologically tested and suitable for sensitive skin.
GAIA Cradle Cap Lotion includes soothing organic Calendula, organic Chamomile and Grapeseed Oil. Calendula is well known for its calming abilities and its soothing and gentle effect on irritated skin, which is why we include it in the GAIA Cradle Cap Lotion. The most gentle of all herbs, chamomile is particularly soothing to skin whilst promoting softness. Chamomile also helps to maintain the general health of hair and bring out natural highlights and shine. Grapeseed oil contains high amounts of omega fatty acids and Vitamin E to bring moisture and help speed up the healing process of cradle cap.

It's a whole new pumping experience, personalised for mum. It's available in 4 different sizes for maximum comfort and pumping efficiency - 21mm, 24mm, 27mm and 30mm.
The rim of the breast shield is made with a soft, natural-feeling material that lays smoothly on the breast for comfort.
More milk and comfort, as tested with mums¹
The new PersonalFit Flex™ breast shield was developed with the help of a team of research scientists and breastfeeding mums. It’s designed to easily adapt to your shape, and encourages your milk flow by helping prevent compression of the milk ducts. This makes it easier for every mum to find the pumping position that’s most comfortable for her. The result? More comfortable, more efficient expression, shaped around you.
Our research scientists tested the PersonalFit Flex™ breast shield in four clinical studies with breastfeeding mums. Across more than 1,000 pumping sessions, they proved it delivered more comfort and efficiency. Like every Medela product, our Flex™ breast pumps are designed to make breastfeeding easier, so you can feed your baby with your amazing milk for longer.

Designed for uninterrupted feeding

Our Anti-colic bottle is designed to keep air away from your baby's tummy to reduce colic and discomfort while also minimising feeding interruptions. With its integrated anti-colic valve, the air is vented away from the baby's tummy.

Less colic

Our anti-colic valve is designed to keep air away from your baby's tummy to reduce colic and discomfort. As your baby feeds, the valve integrated into the teat flexes to allow air into the bottle to prevent vacuum build up and vents it towards the back of the bottle. It keeps air in the bottle and away from the babyâ€™s tummy to help reduce colic and discomfort.

Less fussing

Philips Avent Anti-colic bottle reduces fussing. Babies fed with Philips Avent Anti-colic bottles experienced 60% less fussing at night than babies fed with a competitorâ€™s anti-colic bottle.

Uninterrupted feeding

The teat shape allows secure latch and the ribbed texture helps prevents teat collapse for uninterrupted, comfortable feeding.

Easy to assemble

Our Anti-colic bottle has few parts for quick and simple assembly.

Easy to hold & leak-free

The unique bottle shape makes this bottle easy to hold and grip in any direction. The bottle is designed to prevent leakage whilst feeding, for a truly enjoyable feeding experience.

Easy to clean

With its wide neck and rounded corners, our bottle is easy to clean quickly and thoroughly.

Fits your baby's growing needs

The Philips Avent Anti-colic bottle range offers different teat flow rates to keep up with your baby's growth. Remember that age indication are approximate as babies develop at different rates.

So, when you need to turn screams and sobs into smiles and sleep, simply pick up a Tommee Tippee Natural Latex Soother - Australia's No.1 Natural Latex Cherry Soother*.
The Tommee Tippee natural latex soother is our most natural soother and features a cherry-shaped baglet made from 100% natural latex for added reassurance. Latex is a super soft and flexible material which is similar to the feel of a mother's nipple and breast so there's less chance of confusion when your baby is switching between breast and soother. The round, cherry-shaped baglet mimics the shape of a bottle teat or nipple to encourage your baby to suck in the same way as if they were breastfeeding.
Featuring a reversible baglet, this soother has no 'wrong side-up' so it will always be placed correctly in your baby's mouth, even when your baby puts it in their mouth themselves.
The curved shield sits comfortably between baby's chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture to help protect baby's delicate skin against irritation.
Simple but stylish, the beautiful solid block colours of this cherry latex soothers range are modern and timeless and are sure to complement any outfit
Easy to clean, either by hand, on the top shelf of the dishwasher and suitable for all forms of sterilisation.
In the interests of hygiene, we recommend that you change your baby's soother every month. Always check the soother before each use and replace at the first signs of damage or weakness.
Tommee Tippee recommends stopping soother use when your child is older than 36 months.
All Tommee Tippee soothers are BPA free for your ultimate reassurance.

Use Purelan™ at every feed to relieve soreness and protect your nipples. There is no need to remove Purelan™ before feeding.
Lanolin is a deeply hydrating, naturally occurring substance found in sheep's fleece. The lanolin in Purelan™ nipple cream is ethically sourced using wool from mulesing-free farms. It is highly purified and tested to the industry's highest standards (European and US Pharmacopoeia).
When absorbed into the skin, Purelan™ lanolin cream mimics the skin's natural ability to store moisture and can hold more than twice its weight in water - naturally helping skin's rehydration.
More ways to use Purelan™
As well as soothing dry nipples or soreness during breastfeeding, Purelan™ can be used to moisturise a variety of dry skin areas, such as chapped lips, dry hands and cuticles, elbows and cracked heels.
Purelan™ can also be used for babies and children - to protect skin during cold weather and treat dryness, wherever needed.
Purelan™ is available in 37 g and a handy 7 g size - ready for you to use whenever you need it through the day.

Dr Brown’s teats are precision cut to allow for the maximum performance with the flow of liquid.

Dr Browns Product Information: Our Dr. Browns BPA Free bottle features a patented two-piece internal vent system that works unlike any other bottle design.

The vent system fully vents our bottle for vacuum-free feeding, which we call positive-pressure flow, similar to breast feeding.

As the baby feeds, air is channelled from the teat collar through the vent system, bypassing the breast milk or formula, to the back of the bottle.

Air never mixes with the breast milk or formula which minimises oxidation and helps maintain essential nutrients like vitamins C, A and E. B

abies feed more comfortably because the vent system allows them to nurse without fighting the negative effects of a vacuum or the discomfort of ingesting air bubbles.

This helps to reduce feeding problems like colic, burping, and wind. The breast milk or formula flows freely, without teat collapse. No vacuum, no bubbles, no teat Collapse!",,,"Dr Brown’s teats are made of medical-grade silicone.

The new vent system is designed to grow with baby, and we recommend using this system to experience all the health benefits of our bottle. It helps reduce feeding problems, helps digestion and helps preserve vitamins. Some moms and dads find removing the vent a convenient option as their baby’s feeding becomes more developed. The nipple venting creates a paced flow, and provides a feeding experience similar to most nipple-vented bottles. Options bottles fit most breast pumps, and are BPA-free. This innovative bottle effectively and efficiently covers all parents’ needs. Dr. Brown’s Options grows with the needs of your baby and offers healthy benefits whether your little one is experiencing feeding challenges or not. Options gives you the power of choice.

Dr. Browns BPA Free bottle features a patented two-piece internal vent system that works unlike any other bottle design. The vent system fully vents our bottle for vacuum-free feeding, which we call positive-pressure flow, similar to breast feeding. As the baby feeds, air is channelled from the teat collar through the vent system, bypassing the breast milk or formula, to the back of the bottle. Air never mixes with the breast milk or formula which minimises oxidation and helps maintain essential nutrients like vitamins C, A and E. Babies feed more comfortably because the vent system allows them to nurse without fighting the negative effects of a vacuum or the discomfort of ingesting air bubbles. This helps to reduce feeding problems like colic, burping, and wind. The breast milk or formula flows freely, without teat collapse. No vacuum, no bubbles, no teat Collapse!

Health Benefits

A first-of-its-kind university study to measure nutrient levels in breast milk and formula during a typical 20-minute feeding determined that Dr Brown's fully vented bottles help maintain levels of important nutrients like vitamins C, A & E.

Helps maintain vitamins C, A & E: Patented internal vent system is proven to minimize oxidation of breastmilk and formula, to help maintain essential nutrients. Positive-pressure feeding: Fully vented bottle design provides vacuum-free feeding similar to breast feeding.

Helps reduce colic: Vent system eliminates negative pressure and air bubbles to help reduce colic, burping and wind.",,,"Dr. Brown's bottles are made of BPA-free polypropylene plastic or BPA-free borosilicate glass. All components of the Dr. Brown's bottle, including the vent insert, vent reservoir, travel disk, nipple collar, and cap are also BPA-free polypropylene. Our nipples are made of medical-grade silicone.

So, when you need to turn screams and sobs into smiles and sleep, simply pick up a Tommee Tippee Night time soother. Our Night time soothers feature ingenious glow in the dark handles, so parents can locate the soother in a dark room without having to disturb baby.
Our soother packs feature a reusable steriliser pod that can be used to effectively and efficiently sterilise up to 2 soothers at once in a microwave, killing up to 99.9% of bacteria.
Our orthodontic* Night time soothers feature an oval, reverse ortho baglet that is vented meaning it compresses more easily than traditional, air-filled baglets and therefore reduces pressure on baby's developing teeth and gums. The symmetrical, soft silicone baglet that is fully reversible and has no 'wrong' side-up so the soother will always be placed correctly in your baby's mouth, even when baby puts the soother in their mouth themselves.
The curved shield sits comfortably between baby's chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby's delicate skin against irritation.
The easy to clean, BPA-free silicone baglet is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. We recommend that you replace the soother every month and always at the first signs of damage or wear. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months
To help reduce our environmental impact we have redesigned our soother packaging. Free from single-use plastic, our soothers are packaged in 100% recyclable cardboard.

PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS
  Mixing Guide
1. Always wash your hands before preparing food for your baby.
2. For each tablespoon of cereal, add 2 tablespoons of cooled, boiled water, breast milk, or formula. Breast milk contains enzymes that make the cereal 'watery'. This is perfectly safe to use.

Mixing Guide
1. Always wash your hands before preparing food for your baby.
2. For each tablespoon of cereal, add 2 tablespoons of cooled, boiled water, breast milk, or formula. Breast milk contains enzymes that make the cereal 'watery'. This is perfectly safe to use.
3. Mix to a smooth consistency. Mash out any small lumps with the back of a spoon.
4. Gradually increase amount given and thickness of the cereal over time, depending on your baby's appetite.
Always check the temperature is safe before serving.","High Quality Ingredients: Organic rice flour (79%), Organic Pumpkin (17%), Organic GOS*(from Milk) (3%), Organic Vegetable Oil, Mineral iron, Vitamin C, Rosemary Extract",89615,https://static.chemistwarehouse.com.au/ams/media/pi/89615/F2D_800.jpg

So, when you need to turn screams and sobs into smiles and sleep, simply pick up a Tommee Tippee Night time soother. Our Night time soothers feature ingenious glow in the dark handles, so parents can locate the soother in a dark room without having to disturb baby.
Our soother packs feature a reusable steriliser pod that can be used to effectively and efficiently sterilise up to 2 soothers at once in a microwave, killing up to 99.9% of bacteria.
Our orthodontic* Night time soothers feature an oval, reverse ortho baglet that is vented meaning it compresses more easily than traditional, air-filled baglets and therefore reduces pressure on baby's developing teeth and gums. The symmetrical, soft silicone baglet that is fully reversible and has no 'wrong' side-up so the soother will always be placed correctly in your baby's mouth, even when baby puts the soother in their mouth themselves.
The curved shield sits comfortably between baby's chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby's delicate skin against irritation.
The easy to clean, BPA-free silicone baglet is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. We recommend that you replace the soother every month and always at the first signs of damage or wear. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months
To help reduce our environmental impact we have redesigned our soother packaging. Free from single-use plastic, our soothers are packaged in 100% recyclable cardboard.
*as compared to traditional round unvented soothers which do not compress as easily.
**From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 mums with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee® soother:
**99% of mums would recommend a Tommee Tippee soother

In the first few days and weeks of frequent breastfeeding, many women experience nipple soreness and dry skin. Purelan™ lanolin cream gives you fast relief for sore nipples and dry skin.1-4

It is 100% natural and safe for your baby - you do not need to remove before breastfeeding.

Fast relief for sore nipples and dry skin ¹¯4

Safe for your baby - no need to remove before breastfeeding

100% natural, single-ingredient lanolin. No additives, preservatives and fragrance added

Ultra-pure medical-grade lanolin tested to the highest safety standards, the European Pharmacopoeia and United States Pharmacopoeia standards

Effective - rich texture creates a protective layer on the skin's surface and rehydrates from within

When absorbed into the skin, Purelan™ lanolin cream mimics the skin's natural ability to store moisture and can hold more than twice its weight in water - naturally helping skin's rehydration.

As well as soothing dry nipples or soreness during breastfeeding, Purelan™ can be used to moisturise a variety of dry skin areas, such as chapped lips, dry hands and cuticles, elbows and cracked heels.

Purelan™ is available in 37 g and a handy 7 g size - ready for you to use whenever you need it through the day.

What makes Purelan™ hypoallergenic?

Purelan™ formulation has been developed to minimize its allergenic potential. Carefully controlling the levels of FLA (free lanolin alcohols) in lanolin can reduce skin reactions even among those who are already sensitive to lanolin. Research shows that reducing the FLA content to less than 3%, particularly when detergent residues have been removed from the product, reduces the incidence of positive patch-test reactions among lanolin-sensitive skin patients. With an alcohol fraction of less than 3% in Purelan™, the allergenic potential to lanolin alcohols, which is observed rarely, is reduced to an absolute minimum as per EP (European Pharmacopeia).

Purelan™ does not contain other additives that might cause a reaction, such as preservatives and fragrances.

Additionally, Purelan™ is dermatologically tested. However, anyone with a known lanolin allergy should avoid using lanolin products, including Purelan™.

When should I apply nipple cream?

Use Purelan™ at every feed to relieve soreness, moisturise, and protect your nipples and skin. There is no need to remove the lanolin cream before feeding your baby.

How do you apply the lanolin cream to your nipples?

With clean hands, apply a pea-sized amount of Purelan™ onto your nipple area - the smooth, rich texture of Purelan™ makes it easy to apply. Purelan™ creates a protective layer on the surface of your skin and rehydrates skin from within - relieving soreness while skin heals naturally. There is no need to remove the cream again before feeding.

Little mouths don't always hold onto heavy baby soothers which means parents often need to replace the soother in their baby's mouth every few minutes. Our Ultra-Light Silicone soother is our lightest ever soother and is light enough to stay put in baby's mouth for longer helping babies to stay calmer, soothed and happier for longer. Our orthodontic* soothers feature an oval, reverse ortho baglet that is vented meaning it compresses more easily than traditional, air-filled baglets and therefore reduces pressure on baby's developing teeth and gums. The symmetrical, silicone baglet that is fully reversible and has no 'wrong' side-up so the soother will always be placed correctly in your baby's mouth. The curved shield sits comfortably between baby's chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby's delicate skin against irritation. Our soother packs feature a reusable steriliser pod that can be used to effectively and efficiently sterilise up to 2 soothers at once in a microwave, killing up to 99.9% of bacteria. The smooth surface of silicone is very easy to clean and won't absorb stains and odours. The hygienic, anti-static properties prevent dust from settling and as it has a one-piece design, it is really easy to clean - simply pop in a steriliser, wash by hand or in the top shelf of the dishwasher. We recommend that you replace the soother every month and always at the first signs of damage or weakness and we recommend stopping soother use when your child is older than 36 months. *as compared to traditional round unvented soothers/pacifiers which do not compress as easily. **From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 mums with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee® soother: • 	**99% of mums would recommend a Tommee Tippee soother • 	**97% of mums say a Tommee Tippee soother helped settle baby • 	**93% of mums say babies love their Tommee Tippee soother • 	**97.5 % of babies accepted a Tommee Tippee soother

Preparation Guide for Aptamil Gold+ Reflux

1. Wash hands before preparing the feed. Clean and then sterilise all the utensils by submerging bottles and teats in water and boiling for 5 minutes, or using an approved steriliser.

4. Always add 1 level scoop of powder for each 50mL of water. Cap the bottle and shake for 20 seconds. Leave to stand up to 7 minutes to allow it to thicken.

2. Boil safe drinking water and allow to cool to feeding temperature. CONSULT FEEDING GUIDE. Measure the required volume of water into a sterilised feeding bottle.

5. Test temperature on wrist before feeding. Feed immediately (do not store). Discard unfinished feeds. Prepare each bottle separately. It is safer to use Aptamil Gold+ Reflux immediately after it is prepared. A fast flow or variable flow teat is recommended for this formula. The formula will continue to thicken after preparation and will remain thick in the stomach.

3. Use only the enclosed scoop. Fill the scoop lightly and level using the built-in leveller. Avoid compacting the powder.","Aptamil Gold+ Reflux is a specialty infant formula designed to nutritionally support babies with regurgitation or mild reflux.

Even short bouts of breastfeeding pain can cause damage to the nipples and harm your milk supply. The pain from sore and cracked nipples may even make you want to give up on nursing altogether. Before you decide to go that route, you should know that there is help available for sore nipples.

When the baby is newborn, they typically want to nurse often, and your nipples may become sore and cracked simply because they aren't used to the sucking. Another common cause of breastfeeding pain is that the baby has a poor or shallow latch. When the baby has a good latch, the mouth opens wide around your breast and the nipple is far back in the baby's mouth. It may surprise you to know that babies don't instinctively know how to latch on properly, it's something you and your baby have to practice together, and it may take some time before you both get the hang of it.

Nipple pain is a classic symptom of a poor latch, but you may also notice that your nipples are misshapen, cracked or sore after breastfeeding. Another sign of a poor latch is that the baby is biting the nipple, fussing, rooting and making a clicking noise while nursing. Once your baby masters the art of the good latch, your nipple discomforts will probably become a thing of the past. For quick relief from pain, swelling and sensitivity, apply Multi-Mam Compresses onto your nipples right after feeding your baby. The compresses create a moist environment that soothes sore nipples and supports the natural healing process.

Hygienic and convenient

Multi-Mam Compresses are individually wrapped for hygiene reasons. Each compress is single use. For optimal results, apply compress after feeding for a minimum of 10 minutes, preferably 30 minutes and maximum an hour.

Made from naturally derived ingredients

Multi-Mam's active ingredient is based on the patented 2QR-Complex which is derived from the Aloe Vera plant. The naturally derived formula delivers an instant soothing and cooling effect, going to work immediately to help support the natural healing process.

Multi-Mam Compresses are free from animal derived ingredients such as lanolin

No-rinse formulation

Mothering a newborn means you already have enough on your plate. Our natural origin formula means that there is no need to rinse your nipples after applying Multi-Mam Compresses in between breastfeeding.","Direct Cooling & soothing effect for nipples

Multi-Mam Nipple Compresses are designed specifically for breastfeeding mothers. They provide a direct cooling and soothing effect on nipples and help moisturise the nipple area to alleviate dryness and cracking.

The key ingredient is the plant derived, patented 2QR-complex that creates a barrier to prevent adhesion of harmful bacteria.

The gel does not need to be rinsed between feeds. The compress provides a suitable micro-environment for the gel to condition and moisturise the skin.

Little mouths don't always hold onto heavy baby soothers which means parents often need to replace the soother in their baby's mouth every few minutes. Our Ultra-Light Silicone soother is our lightest ever soother and is light enough to stay put in baby's mouth for longer helping babies to stay calmer, soothed and happier for longer. Our orthodontic* soothers feature an oval, reverse ortho baglet that is vented meaning it compresses more easily than traditional, air-filled baglets and therefore reduces pressure on baby's developing teeth and gums. The symmetrical, silicone baglet that is fully reversible and has no 'wrong' side-up so the soother will always be placed correctly in your baby's mouth. The curved shield sits comfortably between baby's chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby's delicate skin against irritation. Our soother packs feature a reusable steriliser pod that can be used to effectively and efficiently sterilise up to 2 soothers at once in a microwave, killing up to 99.9% of bacteria. The smooth surface of silicone is very easy to clean and won't absorb stains and odours. The hygienic, anti-static properties prevent dust from settling and as it has a one-piece design, it is really easy to clean - simply pop in a steriliser, wash by hand or in the top shelf of the dishwasher. We recommend that you replace the soother every month and always at the first signs of damage or weakness and we recommend stopping soother use when your child is older than 36 months. *as compared to traditional round unvented soothers/pacifiers which do not compress as easily. **From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 mums with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee® soother: • 	**99% of mums would recommend a Tommee Tippee soother • 	**97% of mums say a Tommee Tippee soother helped settle baby • 	**93% of mums say babies love their Tommee Tippee soother • 	**97.5 % of babies accepted a Tommee Tippee soother

INTERESTING FACT:  the flavour of vanilla is sweet and lovely, with a gorgeous aroma and floral hints and babies love it too.

The flavour of your breastmilk does change depending on the foods and spices that you eat.

How long do they last?

We don't use any preservatives in Boobie Bikkies. Each cookie is individually wrapped inside the box to maintain maximum freshness. Best before date is 6 months from date of baking. Please store your bikkies in a cool place to maintain optimal freshness. We recommend you purchase your bikkies closer to the date in which you intend to consume them.

About Baby Massage
Baby massage encourages both eye-to-eye and skin contact and can help establish a close, loving communication, providing security and stability for your child, with amazing therapeutic benefits. Massage releases both oxytocin and endorphins and therefore can assist in relieving discomfort associated with teething, congestion, colic, reflux and emotional stress.
GAIA have taken special care not to interfere with this natural process by ensuring that the essential oils used, make up less than 0.3% of the blend, just enough to cover the nutty smell of the sweet almond oil.
Tip: Suitable for use during pregnancy massage for Mum. Add a couple of drops to your bath to provide an even more nourishing and moisturising bath. Contains pure, natural & organic ingredients

Our filter features a filtration membrane designed to remove bacteria, impurities and contaminants that can be found in water. Water passes through an antibacterial filter to ensure it is clean and safe just like boiled water from a kettle. Do these filters fit both the original and Day & Night Tommee Tippee Perfect Prep machines? The Tommee Tippee plain white filter and blue/white filters are compatible with both Perfect Prep machines. Can I use other branded filters in my Tommee Tippee Perfect Prep machine? We recommend that you only use Tommee Tippee Perfect Prep Replacement Filters in the Perfect Prep machines. Our filter may look a lot like other water filters, but inside is a filtration membrane designed to remove impurities and contaminants. Most standard water filters do not include an antibacterial filtration membrane so will NOT remove bacteria. It is therefore extremely important to use a filter with a proper antibacterial membrane. If in doubt, use an official Tommee Tippee antibacterial filter. Please note that even if the filters vary in appearance, they'll work the same if they're Tommee Tippee branded. How long will each filter last? On average, each Perfect Prep filter should last around 3 months, however this depends on the frequency of use and what size bottles you are preparing. The original Perfect Prep machine features a warning light which will indicate when the filter is due to be replaced and the Day & Night version will display a message on the screen. What are the black particles I can see on the packaging or on the filter? You may find that there's a small residue of black carbon in the bag or on the surface of the cartridge. These dust particles are harmless and will be reduced during the initial set up process when submerging in clean, fresh water. The carbon used in the filter is food grade certified and therefore poses no harm to your little one. *Depending on the amount and size of bottles you use.

Using the Bedwetting Alarm
1. Select which Mode you wish to use via the mode switch.
2. Attach the product to the child's upper arm. Insert the plastic hook into the small loop of the arm band. Adjust the tightness to ensure it fits snugly, but comfortably (not too tight).
3. Attach the sensor clip cord to the alarm connector by lining up the connection pin plastic tabs with the connector grooves and inserting the connection pin. Then turn the connection pin clockwise until it is tightly secured (i.e. you cannot pull the two cords apart).
4. Pass the cord under the child's pyjama top to avoid strangulation risk.
5. Open the sensor clip via the lever and attach it to the child's underwear/ pyjama pants (where urine is most likely). Ensure the sensor clip is closed firmly on the fabric and that the cord does not hinder the child's movement.
6. At the first sign of moisture, the alarm will sound and/or vibrate to wake the child. The LED indicator will flash blue.
7. As soon as the child wakes up (they may need assistance from you) turn off the alarm and unclip it from the child's underwear (you can teach the child to do this themselves). They should then go to the toilet and finish emptying their bladder. 
8. Immediately clean and dry the product (to avoid corrosion of the sensor clip) as per Cleaning instructions and re-attach it to a clean dry pair of underwear or pyjama pants.

Always wash hands with soap and water and dry using a clean cloth. Clean the preparation surface thoroughly before preparing a feed.



Step 2

Clean all feeding equipment in hot soapy water and rinse thoroughly. Next, sterilise all feeding equipment by submerging bottles, teats and lids in boiling water for 5 minutes, or use an approved steriliser.



Step 3

Boil safe drinking water and allow to cool for 30 minutes.



Step 4

Refer to the feeding guide above to check how much powder and water is needed. This is a general feeding guide only. Infants may need more or less formula. Pour the correct amount of previously boiled (now cooled) water into the sterilised bottle.



Step 5

Use only the enclosed scoop, fill scoop and level off using the built-in leveller on the can. Avoid compacting powder.



Step 6

Add the exact amount of powder to the water in the bottle. Always add 1 level scoop of powder for each 50ml of water. Cap the bottle and mix thoroughly by shaking gently or swirling the bottle to dissolve the powder.



Step 7

Check temperature of feed on the inside of your wrist before feeding. It should feel warm, but cool is better than too hot. Feed your baby immediately. Discard any feed that has not been consumed within 1 hour.

A soothing dressing for: nappy rash, chafing, sore lips, minor burns, cuts and rough hands. Protects your skin from windburn and chapping and helps reduce the appearance of fine, dry lines on your skin. Vaseline® Petroleum Jelly is the original wonder jelly. Vaseline has long been used to manage symptoms of many severe skin conditions. It literally melts into the skin, flowing into the tiny cracks caused by dryness where moisture is needed most. In this way Vaseline acts as an extremely powerful skin moisturiser to provide a barrier against water loss from already dry skin and help protect against the effects of weather and exposure. Our petroleum jelly is triple-purified to be 100% pure. Vaseline® believes that truly healthy skin starts with deep moisture. It's not something you get by masking problems or through quick fixes. We know this because we are the original skin experts. Founded in 1870 by Robert Chesebrough, Vaseline® has been safely helping care for skin for over 140 years. It is our goal to make the original, triple-purified Vaseline Petroleum Jelly the core of every product because there is no jelly with a longer history of locking in moisture to strengthen skin barrier and protect dry skin.
