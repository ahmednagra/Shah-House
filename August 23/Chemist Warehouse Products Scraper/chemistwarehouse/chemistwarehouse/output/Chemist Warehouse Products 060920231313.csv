IMPORTANT INFORMATION
  This product is made from synthetic polyisoprene, it does not contain natural rubber latex and is a suitable choice for individuals with a known or suspected allergy to natural rubber latex. 
Condoms are an efficient barrier, however, no method of contraception can provide 100% protection. Made in accordance with international standard ISO 23409:2011.",,"DIRECTIONS FOR USE 
PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY. 
CONDOMS SHOULD ONLY BE USED ONCE. 
Risks involved in re-using condoms include cross infection, tearing and loss of lubrication and strength through cleaning, all increasing the risks of STl's. SKYN® condoms are mode from Polyisoprene. SKYN® condoms do not contain natural rubber latex and are a suitable choice for people with a known or suspected allergy to natural rubber latex. 
1. 	Open the foil, removing the condom carefully. Condoms are strong but they can be damaged by sharp fingernails, teeth or jewellery. 
2. 	Always put the condom on the penis before any sexual contact occurs and only when the penis is erect. This will reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and Sexually Transmissible Infections (STl's). 
3. 	The condom will only unroll one way. Do not fully unroll the condom before use. Check that the condom is the right way up. 
4. 	Gently pinch the tip of the condom to push out trapped air and to make room for semen. Any excess air trapped in the condom may increase the risk of condom breakage. 
5. 	Roll the condom down the length of the penis to its base. 
If you feel the condom slipping or stretching stop and check the condom to avoid potential breakage. 
6. 	Do not use oil based lubricants such as massage gels, body lotions, baby oil, butter, margarine, petroleum jelly etc. as anything containing oil can damage Polyisoprene condoms. Only use lubricants compatible with Polyisoprene condoms. Some medications applied can damage condoms, so always check with your doctor or pharmacist. 
7. 	After sex, and while the penis is still erect, carefully withdraw. Hold the rim of the condom at the base of the penis to prevent ony spillage of semen. Point the penis downwards and carefully slip the condom off. 
8. 	Tie off the end of the used condom and wrap it in a tissue. Dispose of it hygienically. Do not flush the condom down 
the toilet.

An absolute joy!

Unlike other oil-based lubricants, drip offers a lubricant that does not stain, has no stickiness, and leaves no bad fragrance or smell.

Multi-use, great quality!

This oil-based lubricant is great to both vaginal and backdoor play, plus toy use. You do not need to use a lot, which is great. It spreads well and the consistency feels velvety and soft. Easy to clean and does not leave any uncomfortable stickiness. 

I would definitely recommend this product to my clients!

Love the Oil base for when extra slick is needed

The oil based lube is fantastic for when extra slick is needed and water based creates a little too much friction. 😜

Loss of lubrication may increase the risk of the condom tearing, increasing the risk of pregnancy and STI's. Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Always read the label. Use only as directed.
1.	Check the expiry date printed on the condom foil - always. Do not use the condom if the expiry date has passed. If the date has faded, that's not a good sign either! Open the condom wrapper and remove the condom carefully. Condoms are strong but they can be damaged by sharp fingernails, teeth or jewellery - so handle with care.
2.	Make sure to put the condom on the erect penis before any sexual contact occurs. This will reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and STI's.
3.	Check that the condom is the right way up - the roll needs to be on the outside so that it can be rolled downwards. Can't roll it? Wrong way round. 
4.	Gently pinch the tip of the condom to push trapped air and make room for semen. Any excess air trapped in the condom may increase the risk of condom breakage. Plus, it'll be much comfier this way.
5.	Still pinching the tip of the condom, place the condom over the head of the penis and roll it down to the based of the erect penis. All the way. If you need the condom slipping or stretching stop and check the condom to avoid potential breakage. 
6.	Lifestyles® water-based or silicone-based lubricants and gels are recommended during foreplay and sexual intercourse, as they are formulated to increase comfort and pleasure. Lubrication may also reduce the risk of condom breakage. Do not use oil-based lubricant (such as massage oils, body lotions, baby oil, butter, margarine, petroleum jelly etc.) as these may weaken natural rubber latex or polyisoprene condoms. Some medications applied can damage condoms, so always check with your doctor or pharmacist. Always use a lubricant labelled as compatible with condoms. 
7.	After sex, and while the penis is still erect, carefully withdraw the penis. Hold the rim of the condom at the base of the penis to prevent any spillage of semen. Point the penis downwards and carefully slip the condom off. 
8.	Tie off the end of the used condom and wrap it in a tissue. Dispose of it thoughtfully and hygienically. Do not flush the condom down the toilet.

drip products are designed based on real friction points of real people. We test them on ourselves and members of our community to make sure you get less friction and more pleasure.
Our oil based lube was created for people who love the natural lubrication of coconut oil but struggle to get it out of the jar while straddling someone. We liquified it and added a controlled pump, so it goes exactly where you want it to with all the benefits of organic coconut oil.
The sealable lid and removable cap mean it won't spill all over your sheets or sex drawer. We also used 100% recycled plastic, so you don't have to worry about dropping it in the shower, or kitchen, or any of the hard surfaced areas you want to get your drip on.
This 30ml size is perfect for a handbag, bumbag or pocket. Ideal for travel or a spontaneous hook up.

All drip products are made from native Australian botanical formulations, suitable for sensitive skin, glycerin and fragrance free, PH balanced and Vegan.

Indications



Unlike other oil-based lubricants, drip offers a lubricant that does not stain, has no stickiness, and leaves no bad fragrance or smell.
This oil-based lubricant is great to both vaginal and backdoor play, plus toy use. You do not need to use a lot, which is great. It spreads well and the consistency feels velvety and soft. Easy to clean and does not leave any uncomfortable stickiness. 

I would definitely recommend this product to my clients!
Great product that is easy to use, with a lockable lid system. Love it!
The oil based lube is fantastic for when extra slick is needed and water based creates a little too much friction. 😜

Our water based lube was created for people who love lube but don't like the artificial taste, smell and sticky residue. Our premium ingredients and natural botanicals have no flavour or scent, so you can stay in the moment. The formula is long lasting without being sticky so there's no tacky residue to wash off.
The sealable lid and removable cap means it won't spill all over your sheets or sex drawer. We also used 100% recycled plastic, so you don't have to worry about dropping it in the shower, or kitchen, or any of the hard surfaced areas you want to get your drip on.
This size is small enough to still fit in your carry-on and elegant enough to not embarrass you if it falls out of your bag at airport security.

All drip products are made from native Australian botanical formulations, suitable for sensitive skin, glycerin and fragrance free, PH balanced and Vegan.

Indications



I received some samples from Drip a month or so ago, and I am already out of stock! I see clients often who struggle with pain during intercourse and have tried other lubricants full of glycerin and other nasty chemicals that dry out their skin and go tacky after minutes. I am so pleased to say that every one of my clients who has tried the water based and oil based lubes have absolutely loved them and are enjoying sex much more. I would highly recommend this Australian product for anyone with sensitive skin, pain during sex or who just want to experience a luxurious sensation that leaves the skin feeling moisturised rather than dry.
When I saw this on the shelf at my local adult store, I thought I need to give this a whirl after seeing some advertisements around the place and bro, l was not disappointed.

Not only does is look pretty rad, a lube that doesn’t need to be hidden away in the kink box but the glide was just delightful. As an man who likes to take measures into his own hands at times I was excited to test it out on a solo run.

Pros: a little goes a long way, odourless, smooth sexy glide and doesn’t judge me for the supplementary content I’m watching to assist in the process. Used in conjunction with a couple of toys (a sleeve and but plug) and paired as beautifully as full bodied Pinot Noir does with a medium rare scotch fillet - very moreish.

Cons: my housemate will be seeing less of me.

I can confidently say that I will be a frequent Dripper from now on.
It's one thing when a lubricant reduces friction, but a whole other ball game when it leaves your skin hydrated. I have sensitive skin and often struggled with reapplying lubricant or using an excess of it because it would irritate my skin, but this lube has you covered! It's all the fun without the nasties.
Water-based with longevity and great to use, highly reccomend!

PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY. 
CONDOMS SHOULD ONLY BE USED ONCE. 
Risks involved in re-using condoms include cross infection, tearing and loss of lubrication and strength through cleaning, all increasing the risks of STl's. SKYN® condoms are mode from Polyisoprene. SKYN® condoms do not contain natural rubber latex and are a suitable choice for people with a known or suspected allergy to natural rubber latex. 
1. 	Open the foil, removing the condom carefully. Condoms are strong but they can be damaged by sharp fingernails, teeth or jewellery. 
2. 	Always put the condom on the penis before any sexual contact occurs and only when the penis is erect. This will reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and Sexually Transmissible Infections (STl's). 
3. 	The condom will only unroll one way. Do not fully unroll the condom before use. Check that the condom is the right way up. 
4. 	Gently pinch the tip of the condom to push out trapped air and to make room for semen. Any excess air trapped in the condom may increase the risk of condom breakage. 
5. 	Roll the condom down the length of the penis to its base. 
If you feel the condom slipping or stretching stop and check the condom to avoid potential breakage. 
6. 	Do not use oil based lubricants such as massage gels, body lotions, baby oil, butter, margarine, petroleum jelly etc. as anything containing oil can damage Polyisoprene condoms. Only use lubricants compatible with Polyisoprene condoms. Some medications applied can damage condoms, so always check with your doctor or pharmacist. 
7. 	After sex, and while the penis is still erect, carefully withdraw. Hold the rim of the condom at the base of the penis to prevent ony spillage of semen. Point the penis downwards and carefully slip the condom off. 
8. 	Tie off the end of the used condom and wrap it in a tissue. Dispose of it hygienically. Do not flush the condom down 
the toilet.

Indications



I received some samples from Drip a month or so ago, and I am already out of stock! I see clients often who struggle with pain during intercourse and have tried other lubricants full of glycerin and other nasty chemicals that dry out their skin and go tacky after minutes. I am so pleased to say that every one of my clients who has tried the water based and oil based lubes have absolutely loved them and are enjoying sex much more. I would highly recommend this Australian product for anyone with sensitive skin, pain during sex or who just want to experience a luxurious sensation that leaves the skin feeling moisturised rather than dry.
When I saw this on the shelf at my local adult store, I thought I need to give this a whirl after seeing some advertisements around the place and bro, l was not disappointed.

Not only does is look pretty rad, a lube that doesn’t need to be hidden away in the kink box but the glide was just delightful. As an man who likes to take measures into his own hands at times I was excited to test it out on a solo run.

Pros: a little goes a long way, odourless, smooth sexy glide and doesn’t judge me for the supplementary content I’m watching to assist in the process. Used in conjunction with a couple of toys (a sleeve and but plug) and paired as beautifully as full bodied Pinot Noir does with a medium rare scotch fillet - very moreish.

Cons: my housemate will be seeing less of me.

I can confidently say that I will be a frequent Dripper from now on.
It's one thing when a lubricant reduces friction, but a whole other ball game when it leaves your skin hydrated. I have sensitive skin and often struggled with reapplying lubricant or using an excess of it because it would irritate my skin, but this lube has you covered! It's all the fun without the nasties.
Water-based with longevity and great to use, highly reccomend!",,"Apply desired amount for play. Reapply as needed.

PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY. 
CONDOMS SHOULD ONLY BE USED ONCE. 
Risks involved in re-using condoms include cross infection, tearing and loss of lubrication and strength through cleaning, all increasing the risks of STl's. SKYN® condoms are mode from Polyisoprene.

1. 	Open the foil, removing the condom carefully. Condoms are strong but they can be damaged by sharp fingernails, teeth or jewellery. 
2. 	Always put the condom on the penis before any sexual contact occurs and only when the penis is erect. This will reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and Sexually Transmissible Infections (STl's). 
3. 	The condom will only unroll one way. Do not fully unroll the condom before use. Check that the condom is the right way up. 
4. 	Gently pinch the tip of the condom to push out trapped air and to make room for semen. Any excess air trapped in the condom may increase the risk of condom breakage. 
5. 	Roll the condom down the length of the penis to its base. 
If you feel the condom slipping or stretching stop and check the condom to avoid potential breakage. 
6. 	Do not use oil based lubricants such as massage gels, body lotions, baby oil, butter, margarine, petroleum jelly etc. as anything containing oil can damage Polyisoprene condoms. Only use lubricants compatible with Polyisoprene condoms. Some medications applied can damage condoms, so always check with your doctor or pharmacist. 
7. 	After sex, and while the penis is still erect, carefully withdraw. Hold the rim of the condom at the base of the penis to prevent ony spillage of semen. Point the penis downwards and carefully slip the condom off. 
8. 	Tie off the end of the used condom and wrap it in a tissue. Dispose of it hygienically. Do not flush the condom down 
the toilet.

Each condom is electronically tested to meet the highest standards of safety and reliability.",,"DIRECTIONS FOR USE 
PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY. 
CONDOMS SHOULD ONLY BE USED ONCE. 
Risks involved in re-using condoms include cross infection, tearing and loss of lubrication and strength through cleaning, all increasing the risks of STl's. SKYN® condoms are mode from Polyisoprene. SKYN® condoms do not contain natural rubber latex and are a suitable choice for people with a known or suspected allergy to natural rubber latex. 
1. 	Open the foil, removing the condom carefully. Condoms are strong but they can be damaged by sharp fingernails, teeth or jewellery. 
2. 	Always put the condom on the penis before any sexual contact occurs and only when the penis is erect. This will reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and Sexually Transmissible Infections (STl's). 
3. 	The condom will only unroll one way. Do not fully unroll the condom before use. Check that the condom is the right way up. 
4. 	Gently pinch the tip of the condom to push out trapped air and to make room for semen. Any excess air trapped in the condom may increase the risk of condom breakage. 
5. 	Roll the condom down the length of the penis to its base. 
If you feel the condom slipping or stretching stop and check the condom to avoid potential breakage. 
6. 	Do not use oil based lubricants such as massage gels, body lotions, baby oil, butter, margarine, petroleum jelly etc. as anything containing oil can damage Polyisoprene condoms. Only use lubricants compatible with Polyisoprene condoms. Some medications applied can damage condoms, so always check with your doctor or pharmacist. 
7. 	After sex, and while the penis is still erect, carefully withdraw. Hold the rim of the condom at the base of the penis to prevent ony spillage of semen. Point the penis downwards and carefully slip the condom off. 
8. 	Tie off the end of the used condom and wrap it in a tissue. Dispose of it hygienically. Do not flush the condom down 
the toilet.

1. 	Open the foil, removing the condom carefully. Condoms are strong but they can be damaged by sharp fingernails, teeth or jewellery. 
2. 	Always put the condom on the penis before any sexual contact occurs and only when the penis is erect. This will reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and Sexually Transmissible Infections (STl's). 
3. 	The condom will only unroll one way. Do not fully unroll the condom before use. Check that the condom is the right way up. 
4. 	Gently pinch the tip of the condom to push out trapped air and to make room for semen. Any excess air trapped in the condom may increase the risk of condom breakage. 
5. 	Roll the condom down the length of the penis to its base. 
If you feel the condom slipping or stretching stop and check the condom to avoid potential breakage. 
6. 	Do not use oil based lubricants such as massage gels, body lotions, baby oil, butter, margarine, petroleum jelly etc. as anything containing oil can damage Polyisoprene condoms. Only use lubricants compatible with Polyisoprene condoms. Some medications applied can damage condoms, so always check with your doctor or pharmacist. 
7. 	After sex, and while the penis is still erect, carefully withdraw. Hold the rim of the condom at the base of the penis to prevent ony spillage of semen. Point the penis downwards and carefully slip the condom off.
