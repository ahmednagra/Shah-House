A Ma Maniére x Air Jordan 5 “Dusk” And “Dawn” Confirmed For November Release,Closing out the first volume of the boutique's collaborative journey with the Jumpman.,https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/anner.jpg,"<p><a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/a-ma-maniere"">A Ma Maniére</a>‘s latest collaborative effort with Jordan Brand has been a long time coming. And after countless leaks, the boutique has finally confirmed that both colorways of their <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/air-jordan-5/"">Air Jordan 5</a> will be releasing this November.</p>

<p>The sneakers are to debut alongside the premiere of “Still We Rise,” a short film that owes much to the words of James Baldwin and Maya Angelou. Its visuals and story reflect the work of the two esteemed writers, all the while celebrating Black community’s “power and strength in its multitude of identities.”</p>

<p>“Black identity is not a monolith and the Black experience isn’t uniform, James Whitner shares. “It is our diversity that is our strength, we are unified in more ways than the world wants us to believe. All our previous stories led into this moment, building this first chapter we now bring to a close by opening our arms out to the world to bring us all in, across our communities, the diaspora and the world to celebrate unity and culture – but also the one common experience we all have: being desired for your culture, never being told that you belong, but still showing up to do the work – from dusk til dawn.”</p>

<p>Prepared in two different colorways — “Dawn” and “Dusk” — the A Ma Maniére x Air Jordan 5 employs a premium, fine suede upper, with overlaid accents providing a sense of regality and luxury. A Ma Maniére badging marks the tongue and outsole, a custom monogram replaces the shoe’s typical cage, and a custom, jacquard pattern liner calls to mind previous collaborations. A small capsule of apparel completes the collection, consisting of satin bombers, fine cotton anoraks, fleece hoodies, and more.</p>

<p>The A Ma Maniére x Air Jordan 5 “Dawn” will be available online at <a href=""https://www.a-ma-maniere.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a-ma-maniere.com</a> on November 17th in women’s, PS, and TD sizing.

Everything You Need To Know About The Air Jordan 11 “Gratitude”,"History, Sizing, Release Date, Price, and 'Where to Buy' guide.",https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/air-jordan-11-gratitude-buyers-guide.jpg,"<p>What would the holidays be without an <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/air-jordan-11/"">Air Jordan 11</a> release?</p>

<p>This year, Nike, Inc. will treat fans to the <strong>Air Jordan 11 “Gratitude”</strong> retro, a special edition of Michael Jordan’s “Concord” pair from 1995. As you wait for a release, here’s everything you need to know about the 11s coming out December 2023.</p>

<p>Team Jumpman has treated fans to Jordan’s patent leather-covered sneaker every holiday season for over a decade. The Air Jordan 11 “Concord” first released on Nov. 10th, 1995, but was originally previewed by “His Airness” months earlier.</p>

<p>Jordan returned to the Chicago Bulls in March of that year after an 18-month hiatus from the NBA. The story goes that Tinker Hatfield showed the 32-year-old a sample version of his latest Air Jordan design ahead of the 1994-95 NBA Playoffs. Enamored by the sneaker, the Bulls’ now-#45 chose to lace up the pair to face the Orlando Magic against Hatfield’s caution that the pair was not quite ready yet. The sneaker only saw two games as the color scheme (“White/Black/Dark Concord”) did not abide by the league’s regulations. The world would see the shoe again during the 1995-96 season on Jordan’s way to his fourth NBA title.</p>

<p>Retail versions of the sneaker featured “23” on the heel unlike the pair MJ first wore. Priced at $125 USD, the Air Jordan 11 was the line’s marquee offering at the time of its launch. The championship-winning sneaker returned on Oct. 25th, 2000, allowing fans to enjoy the storied pair during MJ’s second retirement from the NBA. A second retail version dropped six years later as part of the “Defining Moments” Pack.</p>

<p>Two-pair box sets are no longer common practice for Brand Jordan, but they were in the mid-aughts. On Jan. 28th, 2006, Nike, Inc. dropped the “Defining Moments” Pack – often simplified to “DMP” – to commemorate the two shoes Michael Jordan wore at the start of each of his three-peats: the Air Jordan 6 and AJ11. The shoes had previously retrod in their original styles, but the special pack brought “Metallic Gold” finishes to both sneakers, detailing inspired by the Larry O’Brien Trophy. The set was priced at $296 and offered in limited quantities at select retailers.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/2020/03/21/air-jordan-6-dmp-2020-ct4954-007-release-date/"">Jordan 6 “DMP”</a> returned on April 18th, 2020, 14 years after its debut. Although old and new fans alike received the pair well, the retro begged the question, “When would the ‘DMP’ 11s return?” Back in January, the sneaker world was treated to a rumor that the “Defining Moments” pair would be Holiday 2023’s Jordan 11 release. The news was immediately met with fanfare but sentiments began to change when early looks at the shoe revealed a major difference.</p>

<p><span class=""embed-youtube"" style=""text-align:center; display: block;""><iframe loading=""lazy"" class=""youtube-player"" width=""2500"" height=""1407"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4XSSwEdlxDI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent"" allowfullscreen=""true"" style=""border:0;"" sandbox=""allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation""></iframe></span></p>

<p>At quick glance, the upcoming Jordan 11 “Gratitude” is a one-to-one replica of its predecessor, but closer inspection reveals premium leather instead of ballistic mesh across the upper. Tuxedo-appropriate patent leather reprises its glossy “Black” look, while branding hits throughout the shoe enjoy “Metallic Gold” flair. Midsoles keep things simple, but their accompanying traction introduces a milky hue that complements the celebratory pair well.</p>

<p>Other differences between both releases include:<br>
<strong>•</strong> Higher-cut patent leather mudguard<br>
<strong>•</strong> Shinier Jumpman on the heel<br>
<strong>•</strong> “23” on spine is its own piece, not printed on<br>
<strong>•</strong> Milky outsole (similar to the “72-10” retro from 2015)</p>

<p>In keeping with the “Gratitude” moniker, the sneaker features a different quote underneath the tongue than all other Jordan 11s: “Quality Basketball Product Created In Gratitude By The Greatest Player Ever” instead of “Quality Basketball Products Inspired By The Greatest Player Ever.” The retro arrives wrapped in tissue paper reading “Thank You” in several different languages.</p>

<p>The box is a lot simpler than the “DMP” launch from 2006, but still enjoys a luxurious “Black/Metallic Gold” color scheme.</p>

<p>Unlike other styles from Nike, Inc., the AJ11 fits true-to-size. The toe box offers ample room for wide-footers, although wearers with flat arches may not find the sneaker all-that-comfortable. Leather on the “Gratitude” 11s should allow for stretching unlike typical ballistic nylon, promising a personalized fit. </p>

<p>The shoe will be offered this holiday season in a size range from 1C to Men’s 18. </p>

<p>The Jordan 11 “Gratitude” releases for the whole family on December 9th via <a href=""https://bit.ly/2M7tavz"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Nike SNKRS</a> and a wide range of retailers. Adult sizing is priced at $230. By comparison, MSRP for kids’ sizes are as follows: $185 for Big Kids (SKU: 378038-170), $100 for Little Kids (SKU: 378039-170), $80 for Toddler (SKU: 378040-170), and $60 for Crib (SKU: CI6165-170). (Pricing may vary by country and currency conversions.)</p>

<p>Nike’s communications team hinted at a Shock Drop for the similar-looking <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/2023/10/10/air-jordan-11-neapolitan-sail-velvet-brown-atmosphere-ar0715-101/"">Air Jordan 11 “Neapolitan”</a> via the SNKRS app on October 23rd. It’s possible the “Gratitude” retro will also release early via this method, rewarding users actively on the app.</p>

<p>Stock numbers for the Holiday 2023 Jordans haven’t been disclosed by the brand, but past Jordan 11s have been suspected to have been produced in the millions. The shoes are likely to quickly sell out upon release. Resale platforms will have the retro on sale for a premium, which varies depending on the market.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Over the course of the last few years, Nike has spread positivity and inclusivity across a number of different releases. And with this newly-revealed <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/nike-dunk-low/"">Dunk Low</a> — which is likely a part of a much larger collection — the brand is further uplifting their audience, reminding everyone to “Be 1 Of One.”</p>

<p>In sneaker culture, nothing is nearly as coveted as a 1-of-1 pair. And though the Nike Dunk Low “Be 1 Of One” may reference said collector’s items, its namesake refers not to itself but to the wearer. Beyond overt yet largely hidden nods to its themes, the colorway’s design and construction are distinct from your typical GR. Alongside a standard, olive leather base, the shoe features quilted overlays with distressed edges, metallic Swooshes tinted in light pink, and branding/embroidered symbols likely exclusive to the pack itself.</p>

<p>Enjoy a closer look at the Nike Dunk Low “Be 1 Of One” via the official images added ahead. At the time of writing this, a release date has not yet been confirmed; for now, sit tight and stay tuned for updates.</p>

<p>A vibrant, albeit straightforward take on the Bruce Kilgore-designed icon, this Air Force 1 boasts a pale shade of yellow along its leather overlays, lace unit, and Swoosh. The branding, too, is painted identically, further contrasting the white neutrals along the unders, lining, and midsole.</p>

The Nike Air Max Plus Drift Expands Tuned Air’s Legacy,The heritage-inspired model is expected to debut Summer 2024.,https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nike-air-max-plus-drift-release-date-1.jpg,"<p>Sean McDowell’s <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/nike-air-max-plus/"">Nike Air Max Plus</a> may not be as heralded as some of its predecessors, but it’s played an important role in the brand’s history. As the sneaker turns 25, the Swoosh has positioned itself to capitalize on the occasion, prepping new colors of the old shoe as well as developing the Air Max Plus Drift.</p>

<p>Reported by Complex’s <a href=""https://www.complex.com/sneakers/a/brendan-dunne/nike-air-max-plus-drift-fd4290-700-2024"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Brendan Dunne</a>, the Nike Air Max Plus Drift is in the works for Summer 2024. The silhouette seemingly borrows the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/nike-air-max-plus/"">Air Max Plus</a>‘ original tooling, coupling it with a new upper. An early look at the Tuned Air inheritor reveals a breathable mesh base underneath a curved molded overlay that runs the length of the shoe. There’s a clear through-line between McDowell’s 25-year-old design and the upcoming model’s update, but the Air Max Plus Drift’s palm tree-reminiscent profile detailing opt for a thicker build. Swooshes go from mid-foot to heel, further differentiating the modern offering from its ’90s predecessor. Underfoot, sole units are near-identical to the first Tuned Air tooling, with whale tail-shaped shanks and their border, and rubber traction at the forefoot opting for new finishes.</p>

<p>The latest in Tuned Air history is set to debut in ensembles clad in vibrant gradients. Neon yellow, “Light Silver,” and “Concord” are some of the hues reportedly arriving on inaugural pairs. The most eye-catching of the bunch will exclusively launch via Nike NBHD (read: “neighborhood”) retailer partners, according to Dunne. Release details are subject to change, but the sneaker is expected to hit stores starting April 2024.</p>

<p>The Air Max Plus Drift is set to be priced at $185 USD, $10 more than a standard Air Max Plus. While you wait for the sneaker to hit <a href=""https://bit.ly/3hYsZCC"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">nike.com</a>, enjoy retailer photos of a beige-colored style ahead.</p>

James Harden Debuts The adidas Harden 8 At Madison Square Garden,"New team, new kicks.",https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/adidas-harden-vol-8-first-look-2.jpg,"<p><em>This article was originally published on May 23rd, 2023 and has been updated on November 6th, 2023.</em></p>

<p>New team, new kicks. James Harden is making his season debut for the Los Angeles Clippers following the massive trade between the Clippers and the Sixers at the start of the 2023-2024 season, and he’s doing so by debuting his new signature shoes on one of the biggest sports stages in the world.</p>

<p>Harden is set to play a starting role for the Los Angeles team as he looks to implement his own self-made system into that of the Clippers. Although it remains to be seen just how this star-studded roster will gel, there’s no denying that they’re one of the most compelling teams in the NBA at the moment, and Harden’s adding more juice with the reveal of the Harden 8 model.</p>

<p>Leaked earlier in May and now spotted on-feet of James Harden, the new 8th model features much of the design language seen in adidas’ sleeker, futuristic direction as seen in the adidas AE1 and the Crazy IIIFINITY. There’s no word on a release date, but we might have to wait until next Spring given the brand’s release schedule for its signature footwear. For now, catch a first look at the former MVP in the adidas Harden 8.</p>

<p>From a preview of the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/2023/02/19/adidas-previews-2023-footwear-at-all-star-weekend-2023/"">adidas Crazy IIInfinity</a> at All-Star Weekend to initial looks at <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/2023/05/17/adidas-anthony-edwards-signature-shoe/"">Anthony Edwards’</a> first signature silhouette, the adidas Basketball banner is ostensibly harkening toward the design ethos of the early 2000s for its future slate of on-court toolings. After suiting up in what was arguably his most widely sought-after silhouette, James Harden’s 8th signature model with the 3-Stripes has recently been unveiled.</p>

<p>Revealed in two colorways via the model’s recently surfaced first look, a few subliminal details from the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/adidas-harden-vol-7/"">Harden Vol. 7</a> make their way over to the upcoming streamlined aesthetic, mirroring the latter’s foot-hugging inner bootie construction and suede toe cap. Elsewhere, the silhouette undergoes a transformative design as the textured upper comes reinforced by a grandiose TPU overlay system that melds into the one-piece sole unit underfoot.</p>

<p>While technical details have yet to be announced, the silhouette’s recapturing of the Y2K era is hit home with a range of both simplistic and gaudy color blockings, such as the monochrome “Black/White” and titular “Orange/Neon” accented effort that can be seen below.</p>

<p>With his signature lines history of a November debut, past iterations could hint at a post-summer release. As we await further details, in the meantime enjoy a first-look at the adidas Harden Vol. 8 below.</p>

<p><a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/crocs/"">Crocs</a> has previously worked with the likes of Bad Bunny and Post Malone – even capturing a segment of the hype market though a partnership with <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/salehe-bembury/"">Salehe Bembury</a> – but the brand has found a certain stride over the past few months. A pair of <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/2023/09/12/shrek-crocs-clog-209373-3tx-release-date/"">Shrek Crocs Clogs</a> kicked things off in early September, bringing mainstream attention to the slip-on connoisseurs. The project with DreamWorks was followed up by the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/2023/10/17/mater-crocs-clog-pixar-cars-209371-0da/"">Mater Crocs</a>, a sequel to the Lightning McQueen clogs released for adults and kids in April 2021. Projects with <em>Demon Slayer</em> and Warner Brothers’ <em>Elf</em> also joined the mix, setting the stage for Crocs’ biggest collaboration yet.</p>

<p>The McDonald’s x Crocs lineup stars Ronald McDonald, as well as the Hamburglar, Birdie the Early Bird, and Grimace. Three out of four pairs prepped as part of the collection are the Classic Clog done in color schemes directly borrowed from their respective characters; a Crocs Cozzzy Sandal, however, is presented in an all-purple look, further proving that the Grimace Shake-spokesfigure does what he wants. McDonald’s branding is found across the entire range of footwear, marking the special occasion. Furthermore, each pair of Crocs by McDonald’s arrives with special Jibbitz sure to drive up the popularity of the “Golden Arches”‘ latest collaboration.</p>

<p>The entire McDonald’s collection is making its way to stores now, with some netizens spotting pairs at their local <a href=""https://bit.ly/3s6feX7"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Finish Line</a> stores. A wide <a href=""https://crocs-us.xkpq.net/Y9472r"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">crocs.com</a> release, however, should take place in the first two weeks of November. The Classic Clogs will release for kids and adults, and range from $50 to $60 USD. Enjoy detailed photos of all four styles ahead.</p>

Wales Bonner’s adidas Originals Fall/Winter 2023 Collection Debuts On November 8th,Inspired by the 90s.,https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/wales-bonner-adidas-samba-ie0578-release-date.jpg,"<p><a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/wales-bonner/"">Wales Bonner</a> isn’t solely responsible for the revival of the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/adidas-samba/"">adidas Samba</a>, but the menswear brand has played an immense role in the sneaker’s return to the mainstream. Unveiled on the runway back in April, the Fall/Winter 2023 collection by Grace Wales Bonner and <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/adidas-originals/"">adidas Originals</a> launches on Wednesday, November 8th. </p>

<p>As with Bonner’s other work, her partnership with the Three Stripes continues to explore Afro-Atlantic legacy through sportswear. Off-pitch styles – elevated knitwear, football shorts – are accompanied by four makeovers of the Samba, adidas’ oldest footwear design still in production. </p>

<p>Two of the three <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/wales-bonner/"">Wales Bonner Sambas</a> enjoy luxe, but faux pony hair uppers, marrying sportswear heritage with high fashion sensibilities. Gum soles also land on the pairs, complimenting the leopard print, light tan, and black makeovers found up-top. By contrast, a fourth adidas Originals style by the British designer opts for a mahogany brown hue that also appears throughout the Fall/Winter 2023 collection’s apparel. Unlike the Samba OG, which has taken over social media feeds and city streets over the last three years, Bonner’s styles feature the long, folded tongue that harkens back to the shoe’s football origins. </p>

<p>Enjoy detailed photos of the latest from the compelling partnership ahead. The Wales Bonner x adidas collection will be available globally on November 8th <a href=""https://bit.ly/2KS67rI"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">adidas.com</a> and the adidas CONFIRMED app. Select retailers across the world will also offer the range of offerings on Wednesday. Each pair ranges from $180 USD to $220 USD.</p>

The New Air Jordan 3 “Doernbecher” Touches Down On December 2nd,This Seattle Seahawks design headlines the Doernbecher Freestyle XIX Collection.,https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-3-doernbecher-FZ3030-919-1.jpg,"<p>In late October, Nike officially unveiled the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/2023/10/27/nike-doernbecher-shoes-2023-release-date/"">Doernbecher Freestyle</a> XIX collection — a six-shoe capsule designed by child patients of OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital. Now, we’re learning of expected release dates for this highly-anticipated for-charity sneaker release.</p>

<p>Designed by Hugo “Juice” Covarrubias Molina, this Air Jordan 3 channels the Legion Of Boom’s distinct colors of navy blue and gooey green, with the latter shade dropping down the ankle as a nod to the young boy’s nickname. In addition to his fandom of the Seattle Seahawks, Juice’s love of blingy jewelry is represented on the hang-tag which is actually plated with 24-carat gold. Finally, a firm message of “It’s okay to be different” appears on the outsole — a powerful mantra that Hugo finds motivation when coping with his Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome condition.</p>

<p>This release marks the second instance in which the Air Jordan 3 was featured in the annual Doernbecher Freestyle sneaker collection. It first appeared in 2010 in a red/silver design; it later re-released in 2013.</p>

<p>A release date is currently expected for December 2nd, 2023 on Nike SNKRS and select Jordan retailers. Additional photos and official Nike images are set to be revealed soon.</p>

The Social Status x Nike Mac Attack “Summit White” Arrives On November 17th,The fourth collaborative effort from the James Whitaker Group.,https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/social-status-nike-mac-attack-summit-white-dz4636-100-1.jpg,"<p>Receiving a timely revitalization in OG form this past summer, the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/nike-mac-attack"">Nike Mac Attack</a> resurgence over the past few months has been headlined through carefully constructed collaborations with James Whitaker’s Social Status brand. Embarking on its fourth iteration of the classic tennis silhouette, Nike will be releasing a “Summit White” version of the model within <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/social-status"">Social Status’</a><br>
bodega-inspired collection.</p>

<p>Save the jet-black collar, heel counter and tread, the upper real estate shines in a bright”Summit White” tint that adheres to the cracked suede overlays while a reflective white finish ascertains the mesh underlays, profile swoosh and inner lining. Complete with a pre-aged midsole that’s become synonymous with the brand’s collaborative series, the neutral-coated effort sees the Charlotte-based brand’s typical embellishments that reminisce on the inner city currency of food stamps with Social Status locations detailing the insoles and an accompanying shopping bag. What’s more, the mid-top trim is complimented by a repeating array of “Pine Green” accents that illuminate the tongue tabs and the heel’s Nike lettering.</p>

The Air Jordan 11 “Neapolitan” Releases On November 11th,A sweet treat for the ladies.,https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Air-Jordan-11-Neapolitan.jpg,"<p>We’ve got another advanced preview of a much-anticipated sneaker release from Jordan Brand’s Holiday 2023 campaign — the annual <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/air-jordan-11/"">Air Jordan 11</a> release exclusively for women.</p>

<p>A tradition started back in 2018, Jordan Brand has been crafting new colorways of this timeless basketball shoe for its women consumer during the Holiday season, and 2023’s offering has the competition even more fierce due to the appeal across all Jordan fanatics. Dubbed the <strong>Jordan 11 “Neapolitan”</strong>, a mix of vanilla sail, chocolate brown, and strawberry pink divvy up this Air Jordan 11 release. Tinker Hatfield’s iconic Air Jordan 11 design maintains its glossy patent leather mudguard, opaque outsole, exposed carbon fiber plate, and signature tie bar on the tongue.</p>

<p>Akin to the Jordan 11 “Gratitude, the ice cream-inspired retro has stirred up a lot of fanfare since early rumors circulated social media. The pair will be offered in Adult and Kids’ sizing, allowing the family to enjoy Jordan Brand’s sweet treat. In late October, official Nike channels hinted at a Shock Drop through the SNKRS app, a practice that has become common amongst popular Jordan releases. What’s different about the “Neapolitan” Shock Drop, however, is that the brand is offering an hour window for participants to purchase the sneaker instead of the typical 10 minutes. </p>

<p>Historically, women’s-exclusive AJ11s haven’t sold out immediately upon launch, leading some pairs to sit on shelves until going on discount. Pairs of the Air Jordan 11 Low for women have also experienced similar fates, so it’s possible the longer Shock Drop window is an attempt to move as much stock as possible before the sneaker’s scheduled release. </p>

The Air Jordan “Gift Giving” Pack Is Perfect For The Golfer In Your Life,Ostensibly harkening back to a special CO.JP offering.,https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-golf-gift-giving-pack-release-date.jpg,"<p>Given Michael Jordan’s love of golf, it’s no surprise that the Jumpman has begun designing sneakers specifically for the green. Their efforts continue with the upcoming Air Jordan 1 High Golf and Air Jordan 6 Low Golf, whose “Gift Giving” colorway ostensibly calls back to an iconic offering from the days of CO.JP.</p>

<p>Leaked back in August of this year, the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/air-jordan-1-golf/"">Air Jordan 1 High Golf</a> “Gift Giving” is a fitting addition to the brand’s Holiday 2023 line-up. Echoing the “Bordeaux” from earlier this Summer, the pair seemingly draws inspiration from one of Jordan Brand’s many Japan-exclusive styles — namely, the “Tokyo” colorway that reappeared back in 2020. Here, silver metallic finishes are applied to the upper’s unders and overlays. But whereas these offer a more matted treatment, the Swoosh, Jumpman logo, packaging, and release-specific logos opt for a much glossier look. Icy blue finishes, then, round out the shoe’s cleated bottom.</p>

<p>Although a part of the same collection, the Air Jordan 6 Low Golf “Gift Giving” opts for a much simpler execution, with smooth white leathers applied over top a silver metallic base. The tread, too, is distinct from that of the Air Jordan 1, as it’s much more akin to the tooling of traditional golf shoes.</p>

<p>Enjoy an official look at the “Gift Giving” pack ahead. Both the Air Jordan 1 High Golf and Air Jordan 6 Low Golf are expected to be available on November 17th via Nike SNKRS.</p>",Air Jordan 1 High Golf,FD6815-001,210,"Nov 17, 2023",Nike SNKRS US,https://bit.ly/2M7tavz,"https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-1-high-golf-metallic-silver-chrome-gift-giving-fd6815-001-3.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-1-high-golf-metallic-silver-chrome-gift-giving-fd6815-001-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-1-high-golf-metallic-silver-chrome-gift-giving-fd6815-001-13.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-1-high-golf-metallic-silver-chrome-gift-giving-fd6815-001-7.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-1-high-golf-metallic-silver-chrome-gift-giving-fd6815-001-10.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-1-high-golf-metallic-silver-chrome-gift-giving-fd6815-001-4.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-1-high-golf-metallic-silver-chrome-gift-giving-fd6815-001-12.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-1-high-golf-metallic-silver-chrome-gift-giving-fd6815-001-6.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-1-high-golf-metallic-silver-chrome-gift-giving-fd6815-001-1.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-1-high-golf-metallic-silver-chrome-gift-giving-fd6815-001-8.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-1-high-golf-metallic-silver-chrome-gift-giving-fd6815-001-5.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-1-high-golf-metallic-silver-chrome-gift-giving-fd6815-001-9.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-6-golf-gift-giving-FD6719-001-11-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-6-golf-gift-giving-FD6719-001-5-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-6-golf-gift-giving-FD6719-001-8-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-6-golf-gift-giving-FD6719-001-1-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-6-golf-gift-giving-FD6719-001-10-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-6-golf-gift-giving-FD6719-001-2-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-6-golf-gift-giving-FD6719-001-6-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-6-golf-gift-giving-FD6719-001-7-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-6-golf-gift-giving-FD6719-001-12-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-6-golf-gift-giving-FD6719-001-4-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/air-jordan-6-golf-gift-giving-FD6719-001-3-2.jpg","Air Jordan, Upcoming Sneakers, Air Jordan 1 Golf",https://sneakernews.com/2023/11/06/air-jordan-golf-gift-giving-pack-release-date/
Everything You Need To Know About The Air Jordan 4 SE Craft “Olive”,Made for Jordan Brand's Holiday 2023 Collection.,https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jordan-4-se-craft-olive-FB9927-200-4.jpg,"<p>The Air Jordan 4 SE Craft is set to return for its sequel on November 18th, dropping in a “Medium Olive” colorway in full family sizes.</p>

<p>Jordan Brand continues to expand its Retro product offering with a new SE Craft style of releases. Debuting in February 2023 with the Air Jordan 4 “Photon Dust”, the SE Craft sets out to elevate the classic Retro silhouete with newer materials such as suede, textured canvas, and more. Thus far, the Air Jordan 4 and Air Jordan 5 have been introduced to the market under the SE Craft.</p>

<p>This holiday season, Jordan Brand will release the Air Jordan 4 SE Craft “Medium Olive”. This release first came to light in March 2023, when trusted sneaker release info source @zsneakerheadz shared a mock-up of an Air Jordan 4 “Olive”. Originally believed to be an all-canvas upper in olive green, it was later revealed that the upcoming release would be another Air Jordan 4 SE Craft style (see the official Nike images at the bottom of the page).</p>

<p>Much like the previous Air Jordan 4 SE Craft “Photon Dust”, the “Medium Olive” will be available in full family sizes for adults ($210), grade school ($160), little kids ($90), and infant/toddler ($85). The Where To Buy section below details all the retailers that will drop the footwear on the scheduled November 18th release date.</p>

Teddy Santis And New Balance Dress The 990v3 MADE in USA Near Entirely In Burgundy,Reportedly found at a New Balance Factory Store.,https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TW-990v3-.jpg,"<p>Every season, Teddy Santis and New Balance add plenty of new colorways to their MADE in USA catalog. And though Fall/Winter 2023 certainly lacked little in the way of releases, the appearance of this <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/new-balance-990v3"">990v3</a> proves that the two have been holding out on us.</p>

<p>For Season 4 of the MADE in USA collection, Teddy Santis and New Balance explored many a new color option. The 990v6, for example, was dressed in a “Burgundy” palette, one not too dissimilar to this newly-revealed pair of 990v3s. Given this, it’s highly likely that the latter colorway was intended to release alongside the rest of the Fall/Winter 2023 collection.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this, it’s unknown when exactly this New Balance 990v3 will officially be hitting the shelves. According to the Reddit user who shared photos of the colorway, the pair was found at one of the footwear brand’s factory stores. For now, as we await further confirmation, sit tight and stay tuned for future updates.</p>

Official Images Of November’s The Simpsons x adidas Collection,"Inspired by Homer, the Simpsons household, and show's opening sequence.",https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/simpsons-adidas-shoes-november-2023-release-dates.jpg,"<p>Matt Groening’s “<a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/the-simpsons/"">The Simpsons</a>” has transcended its two-dimensional format over the last 34 years, becoming a cultural institution. Since 2021, Homer and his fellow citizens of Springfield have been brought to sneaker form by <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/category/adidas/"">adidas</a>, further cementing them as part of the mainstream zeitgeist. </p>

<p>As 2023 winds down, the burgeoning partnership between Groening’s creation and the Three Stripes has prepped another collection ripe for old and new fans of the sitcom alike. Although Homey gets yet another special sneaker, the latest <strong>adidas Simpsons</strong> collection highlights two elements as recognizable as the show’s cast: the clouds displayed during each episode’s opening sequence and the Simpsons’ living room.</p>

<p>Everyone’s favorite family man has already appeared on the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/2023/08/16/adidas-stan-smith-homer-simpson-ie7564-store-list/"">adidas Stan Smith</a>, but he’s got enough time in-between shifts at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant to model for another shoe: the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/2023/06/06/adidas-nmd-g1-release-info/"">adidas NMD G1</a>. A newer silhouette within the Three Stripes’ arsenal, the latest “Nomad” style features BOOST cushioning underneath a vibrant yellow Primeknit upper à la Homer Simpson. The show’s protagonist peeks out from behind the lateral 3-Stripes, which take on a light brown suede also transplanted from Groening’s iconic character. His pants inspire the blue detailing that wraps around the mid-foot and spine, while his “D’oh!” catchphrase is patched onto the top of the tongue. </p>

</p>

<p>While not a “living” character on the show, the series of clouds that introduce “The Simpsons” are iconic in their own right. The Three Stripes cleverly reimagined its adidas adiFOM Superstar with an all-over print of the visible mass of miniature liquid droplets. The reworked <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/adidas-originals/"">adidas Originals</a> promises all-day comfort, which pairs perfectly with the soft-looking clouds that part to reveal “The Simpsons” text in all its yellow glory during every episode’s intro. A rich blue fills in the gaps across the slip-on silhouette, making for an eye-catching offering. </p>

</p>

<p>How many of your favorite “The Simpsons” moments have taken place in the family’s living room? The confined-to-four-walls space has allowed writers and animators of the show set up countless storylines and special moments since 1989. As the room is full of details and colors – many of which have serendipitously won Pantone’s Color of the Year distinction from 2010 to 2020 – the space has been immortalized on the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/adidas-forum-lo/"">adidas Forum Low</a>. Premium suede, leather, corduroy, and chenille come together across the pair’s upper to capture part of the Simpsons household.

The Nike Air Max 95 Dresses In A Winterized “Navy/White” Outfit,With a gradient-infused cushioning system.,https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nike-air-max-95-navy-white-fz4626-400-5.jpg,"<p>From its heralded <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/2023/04/04/corteiz-nike-air-max-95-aegean-storm-fb2709-002/"">Corteiz</a> collaborations to revitalized versions of the pair’s most iconic OG colorways, the Nike Air Max 95 has experienced a relatively curtailed release schedule throughout 2023. As the year draws to a close, the Beaverton brand is extending an inline collection featuring the Sergio Lozano design draped in winter-ready pitch-dark palettes.</p>

<p>Having already been previewed in a greyscale and pitch-black effort, the Air Max 95’s latest series of releases are all sewn from the same elements; bearing colorfully trimmed swooshes, clad-colored uppers and a gradient-infused Air Max cushioning system. For its third installment in the unnamed cohort, a strict navy treatment ensues across the entirety of the upper. While light blue hits animate the miniature heel swoosh and the tongue tab’s Air logo, a crisp white sole unit juxtaposes the murky composition above while a cerulean blue-to-dark navy transition ensues underfoot.</p>

<p>Release details haven’t been confirmed just yet. So in the meantime, the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/nike-air-max-95/"">Nike Air Max 95</a> “Navy/White” can be seen ahead in detailed imagery.</p>

Everything To Know About The Nike Zoom GT Cut 3,The third chapter of the high-performing G.T. Cut series arrives in Spring 2024.,https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tcu3.jpg,"<p>The future of Nike Basketball resides in the Greater Than series, split between the sport’s three main player profiles; the GT Jump for big men, the GT Cut for speedsters and the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/nike-zoom-gt-hustle-2/"">GT Hustle</a> for those in between. While the latter has since been released in its third iteration alongside an expected team-up with Victor Wembanyama throughout the coming NBA Season, the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/2023/11/06/nike-gt-cut-3-spring-2024-release-info-dv2918-101/"">Nike GT Cut 3</a> has since been officially revealed.</p>

<p>The inaugural Nike GT Cut quickly became one of the most widely-regarded on-court toolings from The Swoosh in recent memory, however routine shipping delays surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic prevented the lauded model from ever truly receiving the limelight. For its third volume, the silhouette undergoes a striking disconnect from the streamlined simplicity of its past counterparts while maintaining the potential to rival the success of its initial solution.</p>

<p>Mirroring the low-top trim and risen tongue construction of the <a href=""https://sneakernews.com/tag/nike-kd-3/"">Nike KD 3</a>, the GT Cut 3 expands upon the perforations of its past composition by filling the mid-foot, heel counter and tongue with a litany of breathable slits. Boasting a split build at the forefoot, the front half of the model exercises a Flywire-reminiscent detailing that consumes the upper in a vectorized aesthetic. The latter strikes the forefoot and mid-foot of the lightweight textile upper for reinforced containment while a TPU component wraps up the lateral sidewall to help keep the wearer locked above the footbed. Underfoot, the herringbone traction system is informed by pressure mapping with specific pods placed at high-stress points along the outsole for optimum grip during precise and quick cuts.</p>

<p>In terms of the cushioning set-up, Nike has transitioned its running model’s synonymous Zoom X cushioning system into the GT Cut 3’s midsole, marking its first appearance within a Nike basketball shoe. Resembling the visibility of the Air Max roster with a sliver of foam housed within an extended heel clip, the Beaverton brand’s team of designers recontextualized the midsole to achieve a lower stack height than that of its predecessor. As such, the sole unit’s low court-feel is complimented by the lightest construction in the three-model series.</p>

<p>The Nike GT Cut 3 is currently scheduled to release in Spring of 2024 for a retail price of $170. While we await further release details, the pair can be seen ahead in detailed imagery.</p>",,,,,,,"https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nike-gt-cut-3-spring-2024-release-info-DV2918-101-5.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nike-gt-cut-3-spring-2024-release-info-DV2918-101-1.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nike-gt-cut-3-spring-2024-release-info-DV2918-101-8.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nike-gt-cut-3-spring-2024-release-info-DV2918-101-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nike-gt-cut-3-spring-2024-release-info-DV2918-101-3.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nike-gt-cut-3-spring-2024-release-info-DV2918-101-4.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nike-zoom-gt-cut-3-DV2918-101-8.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nike-zoom-gt-cut-3-DV2918-101-7.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nike-zoom-gt-cut-3-DV2918-101-6.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nike-zoom-gt-cut-3-DV2918-101-2.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nike-zoom-gt-cut-3-DV2918-101-1.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nike-zoom-gt-cut-3-DV2918-101-3.jpg, https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nike-zoom-gt-cut-3-DV2918-101-4.jpg","Basketball, Upcoming Sneakers, Nike Zoom GT Cut 3",https://sneakernews.com/2023/09/30/nike-zoom-gt-cut-3-first-look/
